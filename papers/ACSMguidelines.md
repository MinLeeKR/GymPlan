## Chapter 1: Making Healthy Lifestyle Choices — Physical Activity and Nutrition

What you do truly matters for your health. Your level of physical activity and dietary choices affect your daily function and your risk for diseases such as heart disease and some cancers. Healthy lifestyle choices are shaped by individual and biological factors, as well as your home, work, and community environments (see Figure 1.1).

You are unique and need an individualized plan to achieve your health and fitness goals.

Rather than viewing healthy choices as isolated actions, consider how various influences in your life interact to support or challenge your efforts. By reading this book, you have already taken the first step toward improving your health and wellness. The following pages provide research-based recommendations for exercise and diet, with chapters written by experts in each field. These recommendations are most valuable when applied within the context of your own life and experiences. With this perspective, you can develop an action plan to begin or improve your wellness journey. Time to get started!

## Defining Wellness

How do you define wellness? Your definition will reflect your personal experiences and perspectives. One way to view wellness is as engaging in activities to avoid negative outcomes—for example, exercising to prevent disease or choosing water over sweetened beverages to avoid weight gain. A more positive approach focuses on balancing the many aspects, or dimensions, of life to promote health (8). For example, exercising to develop fitness for recreational activities you enjoy, or eating a balanced diet to provide your body with the nutrients it needs for optimal function. The outcomes may be similar, but the mindset is about pursuing health rather than simply avoiding illness.

Wellness includes physical, emotional, social, intellectual, spiritual, and occupational aspects (11). Wellness exists on a continuum between the presence and absence of each dimension. Table 1.1 provides brief definitions and sample indicators for each wellness dimension. Consider where you fall on the continuum for each aspect. Wellness is dynamic and ever-changing; at any time, some dimensions may be more present in your life than others. By adopting healthy behaviors, you can achieve greater balance and a stronger sense of well-being and health.

## Table 1.1: Dimensions of Wellness Indicators

| Dimension    | Description                                         | Absent           | Present         |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Physical     | Ability to carry out daily activities with vigor    | Unfit            | Fit             |
| Emotional    | Understand feelings, accept limitations, stability  | Miserable        | Content         |
| Social       | Relate well to others inside/outside family unit    | Disengaged       | Connected       |

## Promoting Health and Wellness

Seeking better health involves many daily decisions and actions. This section explores the benefits of physical activity and exercise, as well as dietary choices. Ensuring adequate sleep and managing stress are also integral to your pursuit of health and wellness.

## Physical Activity and Exercise

Physical activity recommendations are not new, but the message has become clearer in recent years. In 1996, the U.S. Surgeon General’s Report on Physical Activity and Health described physical activity as “a passport to good health for all Americans.” The goal was to weave physical activity into daily life, highlighted by these take-home points (27):

- Americans can substantially improve their health and quality of life by including moderate amounts of physical activity in their daily lives.
- For those already achieving regular moderate activity, further increases bring additional benefits.
- Health benefits from physical activity are achievable for most Americans.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services later provided clear recommendations in its Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (25), based on hundreds of research studies. Major findings include:

- Regular physical activity reduces the risk of many unwanted health outcomes and diseases.
- Some activity is better than none. The greatest health risk comes from being totally sedentary. Even 60 minutes of activity a week can provide benefits.
- A target of 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity provides significant health benefits (e.g., brisk walking).
- Additional benefits are possible by increasing intensity, frequency, or duration.
- The benefits of physical activity outweigh possible adverse outcomes.
- Regular exercise, week after week and year after year, is the goal. Start early and continue throughout life.

Current ACSM recommendations continue to support a comprehensive exercise program (1, 10). The following chapters provide more detail on balanced exercise programs and the role of activity and nutrition in promoting health and fitness throughout the lifespan, including for those with special health conditions.

---

## Physical Activity vs. Exercise

Both physical activity and exercise are valuable, but there is a subtle difference (1):

- **Physical activity** refers to any movement of the body that requires energy above rest (e.g., light gardening, household chores, taking the stairs).
- **Exercise** is a specific, planned type of physical activity done in a structured manner to promote fitness (e.g., brisk walking for aerobic fitness, lifting weights for muscular fitness).

Physical activity is the umbrella term; exercise is a category within it. Both are important, and the terms are often used interchangeably.

---

## Sit Less, Move More

Reflect on how much time you spend sitting each day: commuting, working at a computer, watching TV, etc. One study reported the following averages for nonsleeping activity levels (19):

- Moderate to vigorous physical activity: 0.3 hours
- Light physical activity: 4.1 hours
- Sedentary: 10.2 hours

High amounts of inactivity and little time spent in moderate or vigorous activity are common. Research supports the recommendation to sit less to promote health. Higher sitting time is associated with increased risk for heart and metabolic issues, regardless of other activity levels (20, 23). Ways to infuse more activity into your day include:

- Stand or walk while talking on the phone
- Move during TV commercials
- Take movement breaks every half hour when working at a desk
- Go for a short walk after meals

Keep looking for additional ways to add activity to your day!

---

## Why Be Active?

Being active is one of the most important habits for people of all ages (1, 25). Benefits include:

- Children: healthy body weight, better school performance, higher self-esteem, lower risk of heart disease risk factors (22, 25)
- Adults: better stress management, lower depression risk, ability to perform daily tasks, healthy body weight, lower disease risk (10, 25)
- Older adults: quality of life, independence, improved immunity, bone health, movement, balance, psychological well-being, lower disease risk (9)

Even with disabilities or chronic conditions, being as active as possible within your ability brings health benefits. Consult with a healthcare provider for appropriate activity levels (25).

## Table 1.2: Health Benefits Associated With Regular Physical Activity

| Age Group                | Strong Evidence                                      | Moderate Evidence                |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Children & Adolescents   | Improved cardiorespiratory/muscular fitness, bone health, cardiovascular/metabolic biomarkers, favorable body composition | Reduced symptoms of depression   |
| Adults & Older Adults    | Lower risk of early death, heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, adverse blood lipid profile, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, colon/breast cancer, prevention of weight gain, weight loss (with reduced calories), improved fitness, prevention of falls, reduced depression, better cognitive function (older adults) | Better functional health (older adults), reduced abdominal obesity, lower risk of hip/lung/endometrial cancer, weight maintenance after loss, increased bone density, improved sleep quality |

## Components of Fitness

Fitness is multifaceted, including health-related (aerobic fitness, muscular fitness, flexibility, body composition) and skill-related (agility, coordination, balance, reaction time, power, speed) components (1).

Skill-related components are important in sports and daily activities. For example, carrying laundry around obstacles requires strength and balance. This book covers aerobic fitness, muscular fitness, flexibility, and neuromotor (functional fitness) training.

---

## Aerobic Fitness

"Aerobic" means "with oxygen." Your heart, lungs, and blood vessels supply your muscles with oxygen during aerobic exercise (e.g., walking, jogging, running, cycling, swimming, dancing, hiking, tennis, basketball). Regular aerobic activity lowers risk factors for heart disease, high blood pressure, unhealthy cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes (10). Lifestyle modifications, including weight loss and increased activity, can delay or prevent diabetes progression (2). Physical activity also helps control blood glucose in people with diabetes (see chapter 13).

---

## Muscular Fitness

Muscular fitness is your muscles’ ability to contract to lift, pull, push, and hold objects. It can be improved with resistance training (e.g., weights, resistance bands, bodyweight exercises). Benefits include improved muscle function, body composition, blood pressure, glucose control, bone strength, and confidence. Resistance training is important for all ages, including children and older adults (1, 9, 10, 25).

---

## Flexibility

Flexibility is the ability to move a joint through its full range of motion. It can be maintained or improved through stretching (1). Flexibility is important for daily activities and can be affected by injury, disuse, or aging. See chapter 7 for stretches and benefits.

---

## Neuromotor Exercise

Neuromotor (functional fitness) training includes activities that improve balance, coordination, gait, agility, and proprioception (1). Examples: yoga, tai chi, qigong. Benefits include improved balance, agility, and strength, and reduced fall risk, especially for older adults.

---

## Body Composition

Body composition refers to the makeup of your body (lean tissue vs. fat). Excess body fat, especially abdominal fat, is linked to poor health outcomes (1). Chapter 18 covers weight management.

---

## Diet and Nutrition

Choices about what to eat and drink are made repeatedly each day. Good nutrition is not about restriction, but about enjoying nutritious, delicious foods. The "diet" here means what you eat, not a weight loss plan.

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans are updated every five years (28). The 2015 guidelines note that about two-thirds of American adults are overweight or obese, and about half have at least one preventable chronic disease. Contributing factors include poor diet, excess calories, and inactivity. Dietary patterns are linked to risk for obesity, chronic diseases, and possibly neurocognitive disorders and congenital anomalies (29).

A healthy eating pattern includes vegetables, fruits, grains (at least half whole grains), fat-free or low-fat dairy, and a variety of protein foods, while limiting saturated/trans fats, added sugars, and sodium (28). These strategies can be individualized to fit health needs, preferences, and cultural traditions.

---

## Sleep and Stress Management

Embracing a physically active lifestyle and healthy food choices is important, but sleep and stress also significantly influence health.

### Influence of Sleep

Chronic sleep loss or sleep disorders affect up to 70 million people (15). Adequate sleep (quantity and quality) is essential for energy, alertness, productivity, relationships, and physical health. Adults typically need 7–8 hours per night (15). Daytime sleepiness is a clear indicator of insufficient sleep. Tracking your sleep habits can help.

Sleep is important for:
- Cardiovascular health (heart rate and blood pressure fluctuate during sleep)
- Cell and tissue repair (growth hormone released during deep sleep)
- Immune function (cytokine production)
- Appetite regulation (leptin increases, ghrelin decreases)

Inadequate sleep impairs learning, concentration, and reaction time (15).

**Tips for Better Sleep (18):**
- Stick to a sleep schedule, even on weekends
- Practice a relaxing bedtime ritual
- Exercise daily
- Ensure your bedroom has ideal temperature, sound, and light
- Sleep on a comfortable mattress and pillows
- Beware of hidden sleep stealers (alcohol, caffeine)
- Turn off electronics before bed

Consult a physician or sleep professional if you experience:
- Daytime sleepiness
- Snoring
- Leg cramps or tingling
- Gasping or difficulty breathing during sleep
- Prolonged insomnia
- Any other symptom preventing good sleep

---

### Influence of Stress

Everyone experiences stress. At its core, stress is the brain’s response to demands (16). Types of stress include:
- Acute stress
- Episodic acute stress
- Chronic stress

**Acute stress** is short-term, from recent or anticipated events (e.g., losing keys, handling a complaint). Symptoms: irritability, anxiety, tension headaches, muscular tension, digestive issues, higher blood pressure, faster heart rate, sweating, shortness of breath, chest pain.

**Episodic acute stress** occurs when acute stress is frequent (e.g., always rushing, ongoing worry). Symptoms: persistent tension headaches, migraines, high blood pressure, chest pain, heart disease.

**Chronic stress** is ongoing and unrelenting. It can cause anxiety, insomnia, muscle pain, high blood pressure, weakened immune system, and contribute to heart disease, depression, and obesity (6).

Short-term stress allows you to return to a relaxed state. Long-term stress keeps the body in an alert state, leading to breakdown and system failure over time (12). Stress can affect almost every body system: muscular tension, digestive issues, elevated stress hormones, blood sugar, increased risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, or stroke (3).

Common sources of stress: money, work, the economy, family responsibilities, personal health (4). Symptoms: anger, anxiety, lack of motivation, fatigue, depression, feeling overwhelmed (4).

**Managing Stress:**
- Plan your schedule for effective time management
- Avoid procrastination
- Relax with deep breathing
- Limit alcohol consumption
- Talk to family and friends

If stress cannot be managed with basic techniques, seek help from a psychologist or licensed mental health professional (6).

Making healthy lifestyle choices can be challenging, but developing healthy habits is worth the effort. Some benefits are long-term (e.g., heart health), while others are immediate (e.g., stress reduction). Regular physical activity and healthy nutrition promote physical wellness.

## Influences or Determinants of Health

**Figure 1.1.** Diet and physical activity, health promotion, and disease prevention across the lifespan. (Source: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2015.)

Health is shaped by a complex interplay of factors:
- Household, social, and cultural factors
- Individual and biological factors
- Community and environmental factors
- Systems and sectors
- Public and private sector policies
- Diet and physical activity patterns and behaviors

These influences affect healthy weight, health promotion, physical fitness and function, nutritional status, and chronic disease prevention, ultimately impacting health outcomes.

## The Mindset of Wellness

A balanced diet provides your body with the nutrients needed for optimal function. While outcomes may be similar, the mindset should focus on pursuing health rather than simply avoiding illness.

Wellness reflects physical, emotional, social, intellectual, spiritual, and occupational aspects (11). Wellness exists on a continuum between the presence and absence of each dimension. Consider where you fall on the continuum for each aspect. Wellness is dynamic and ever-changing; at any time, some dimensions may be more present in your life than others. By adopting healthy behaviors, you can achieve greater balance and a stronger sense of well-being and health.

Wellness touches all aspects of life, and fully discussing all areas is beyond the scope of this book. The focus here is physical wellness, with an introduction to the benefits of physical activity and a healthy diet. In addition, insights into two areas that can affect physical wellness—sleep and stress management—are discussed next.

## Q&A: What Are Current Activity Levels in the United States?

Although the Surgeon General’s report highlighted the importance of physical activity, it did not spark the desired increase in activity. The following chart (Figure 1.2) shows the percentage of adults who engage in aerobic and muscular activity, as well as those who are inactive during leisure time (26):

![Figure 1.2: Percentages of Americans who engage in moderate aerobic activity and resistance training and those who are inactive in their leisure time.](figure1.2.png)

**Figure 1.2.** Percentages of Americans who engage in moderate aerobic activity and resistance training, and those who are inactive during leisure time. (Data from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2016.)

In a perfect scenario, 100% of people would exercise (aerobically and with resistance training), and no one would remain inactive during leisure time. The most active age group is the youngest; unfortunately, activity decreases and inactivity increases with age. Currently, the percentages are far from ideal. Now is the time for everyone to increase physical activity and find enjoyable ways to be more active.

---

## Key Takeaways on Physical Activity

- **Some physical activity is better than none.** The greatest health risk comes from being totally sedentary. Getting up and moving is important to start reducing disease risk and claiming benefits. Some health benefits have been identified with as little as 60 minutes of activity a week.
- **A target of 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity** provides significant health benefits (additional benefits accrue to those who do more). An example of moderate-intensity activity is brisk walking.
- **If you are already active, additional benefits are possible** for most health outcomes if you increase the amount of physical activity by exercising at a higher intensity, more often, or for a longer period of time.
- **When considering risks versus benefits, the benefits of physical activity outweigh possible adverse outcomes.**
- **Regular exercise, week after week and year after year, is the goal.** Maintaining such a program can produce both short-term and long-term benefits. Starting early in life and continuing throughout the lifespan is recommended.

Current recommendations from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) continue to support the value of a comprehensive exercise program (1, 10). The upcoming chapters reflect these research-based guidelines, providing more detail on the components of a balanced exercise program and the role that activity and nutrition play in promoting health and fitness throughout the lifespan, as well as when people are faced with special health conditions.

---

## Physical Activity vs. Exercise: What's the Difference?

Both physical activity and exercise are valuable. Although similar in some ways, there is a subtle difference between these two terms (1):

- **Physical activity** refers to movement of the body that takes effort and requires energy above that required at rest. Day-to-day tasks such as light gardening, household chores, and taking the stairs at work are examples of baseline physical activity. Including activities like these in your daily routine is helpful, but adding exercise to your schedule provides additional health and fitness benefits.
- **Exercise** is a specific, planned type of physical activity that is done in a structured manner to promote physical fitness. Going for a brisk walk with the purpose of increasing your aerobic fitness or lifting weights to improve muscular fitness are both physical activity options that fall under the category of exercise.

Thus, physical activity is a broader, umbrella term, and exercise is one category of physical activity (i.e., all exercise is physical activity but not all physical activity is exercise). Over the past few years, the value of both physical activity (see next section) and exercise has been supported. The focus of this book is exercise, but realize that exercise is a type of physical activity and that the terms are often used interchangeably.

---

## Sit Less, Move More

Reflect on the amount of time you spend sitting over the course of the waking hours of the day: sitting while commuting, working at the computer, watching television, and at other times throughout the day. One study reported the following averages for nonsleeping activity levels (19):

- Moderate to vigorous physical activity: 0.3 hours
- Light physical activity: 4.1 hours
- Sedentary: 10.2 hours

These averages display a high amount of time spent each day in inactivity, with little time spent being physically active at moderate or vigorous levels.

Research supports the recommendation to sit less as a means to promote health. All-cause death rate is higher for those who sit more, and that association was found regardless of how active a person was otherwise (20). Sitting time has been associated with higher risk for heart- and metabolic-related issues such as increased waist circumference, poorer insulin resistance (how the body handles glucose), and changes in cholesterol (sitting is detrimental to “good” cholesterol levels) (23).

**Tips to infuse more activity into your day:**

- Stand or walk while talking on the phone
- Get up and move during commercials when watching TV
- Include some movement time every half hour when working on the computer or doing desk activities
- Go for a short walk after meals

Keep looking for additional ways to infuse activity into your day!

ACSM’s Complete Guide to Fitness & Health
Being active is one of the most important habits people of all ages can develop
to improve their health (1, 25). Why are physical activity and exercise so important
to your well-being? Children who are active are more likely to be at a healthy body
weight, perform better in school, and have higher self-esteem (22). They are also less
likely to develop risk factors for heart disease, including obesity (25). Adults who
exercise are better able to handle stress and avoid depression, perform daily tasks
without physical limitation, and maintain a healthy body weight; they also lower their
risk of developing a number of diseases (10, 25). Exercise continues to be important
for older adults by ensuring quality of life and independence; regular exercise boosts
immunity, combats bone loss, improves movement and balance, aids in psychological
well-being, and lowers the risk of disease (9). Physical activity and nutrition informa-
tion for children and adolescents is found in chapter 9, for adults in chapter 10, and
for older adults in chapter 11.
Although disabilities may affect one’s ability to be physically active, research sup-
ports the health benefits for avoiding inactivity and becoming as regularly active as
possible within one’s ability. An appropriate physical activity level can be determined
in consultation with a health care provider (25). Similarly, people with chronic medical
conditions should consult with their health care providers regarding the appropriate
types and amounts of activity (25). Chronic medical conditions encompass a wide range
of situations, including arthritis, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. Within the limitations of
their ability, adults with chronic medical conditions can obtain health benefits from
regular physical activity (25). Chapters 12 to 17 include nutrition and physical activity
recommendations unique to a number of chronic conditions, including heart disease,
high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, osteoporo-
sis, and arthritis. In addition, the value of regular physical activity and healthy dietary
choices is reviewed for weight management (chapter 18), pregnancy and postpartum
(chapter 19), and depression (chapter 20).
The benefits of a regular exercise program extend into many areas of life. Improve-
ments in body function as a result of exercise are well documented and are highlighted
in this chapter. In addition to physiological benefits, psychological and mental health
benefits can also be realized. Exercise appears to provide relief from symptoms of
depression and anxiety; in addition, exercise enhances well-being and quality of life
and is associated with a lower risk of dementia (10). Exercise also has the potential
to enhance emotional well-being and improve mood (21). Researchers continue to
explore why exercise promotes mental well-being. Potential reasons include offering
a distraction, increasing self-confidence, providing physical relaxation, and promoting
a positive body image (13).
Stated simply, exercise is the best prescription! No other “product” can provide so
many positive changes with so few side effects. To underscore this, take a moment to
review the impressive summary list of health benefits related to physical activity, for
all age groups, in table 1.2. The scientists working with the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services rated available evidence as strong, moderate, or weak based on
the type, number, and quality of the research studies (25). Only the health benefits
with at least moderate evidence are included in this table.
As a reader of this book, you can claim these benefits for yourself. Be encouraged!
Regardless of your current level of physical activity, the information provided in the
upcoming chapters will help you create a realistic, workable exercise plan that has the
potential to change your life for the better. Fitness is multifaceted, including health-

## Components of Fitness

Fitness is multifaceted, including:

- **Health-related components:** aerobic fitness, muscular fitness, flexibility, and body composition
- **Skill-related components:** agility, coordination, balance, reaction time, power, and speed (1)

Skill-related components are important not only in sports and athletic competitions, but also in daily life. For example, navigating around children’s (or pets’) toys while carrying a full basket of laundry requires strength, balance, and coordination.

This book dedicates individual chapters to aerobic fitness, muscular fitness, flexibility, and neuromotor (functional fitness) training. Neuromotor training encompasses many aspects of skill-related fitness. Each component ensures your body operates at its optimal level, influencing your ability to engage in both exercise and daily activities.

---

## Aerobic Fitness

"Aerobic" means "with oxygen." Your heart, lungs, and blood vessels work together to supply your muscles with needed oxygen during aerobic (cardiorespiratory endurance) exercise. Examples include walking, jogging, running, cycling, swimming, dancing, hiking, and sports such as tennis and basketball.

Regular aerobic activity is associated with lower risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure and unhealthy cholesterol levels (10). If you are already somewhat active, you can further reduce your risk by engaging in additional physical activity. Cardiovascular health—including heart disease, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol—is discussed in more depth in chapter 12, and weight management in chapter 18. Aerobic activity also reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes (10).

Progression from prediabetes (elevated blood glucose levels that increase the risk of developing diabetes in the future) to diabetes can be delayed or even prevented by losing weight and increasing physical activity (2). Lifestyle modifications can have a definite impact. In addition, physical activity can help control blood glucose in people diagnosed with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes (see chapter 13 for details).

Chapter 5 explains more fully the recommendations on aerobic activity as well as how you can progress over time.

Chapter 5 explains more fully the recommendations on aerobic activity as well as how

Muscular Fitness
Muscular fitness refers to how your muscles contract to allow you to lift, pull, push,
and hold objects. Muscular fitness can be improved with resistance training. As with
aerobic fitness, many exercise options are available, including lifting weights, using
resistance bands or cords, and performing body weight exercises such as push-ups
and curl-ups. The key is to find activities that you enjoy and that are available to
you. Chapter 6 provides details on various types and modes of activity that can help
strengthen your muscles, as well as specific exercises and how-to photos to help you
get started or improve your current resistance training program.
When you consider muscular fitness, the first picture in your mind might be a
competitive athlete with large muscles. Although increases in muscle size are possible
Q&A
Why is it important to engage in aerobic exercise?
When you exercise so that your heart beats faster and you breathe at a quicker rate,
you are providing a positive type of stress on your cardiorespiratory system as well as
your entire body. This stress, or overload, is needed in order to improve fitness and
health. An inactive lifestyle does not provide this positive stress and therefore leads to
inactivity-related diseases such as heart disease. A sedentary lifestyle and obesity have
been described as “parallel, interrelated epidemics in the United States” with reference
to their contribution to the risk of heart disease (14). It is vital to find ways to fit physical
activity into your daily life.
Making Healthy Lifestyle Choices 11
Q&A
What typically happens to muscle
mass over the course of adulthood?
Adults have a real need to maintain resistance training because typically, over the course
of adulthood, the amount of muscle decreases while the amount of body fat increases
(9). Declines in muscle mass begin around age 40, and the decline accelerates after
around age 65 to 70 (9).
with resistance training, for most people a more relevant reason to include resistance
training is to improve muscle function in order to handle activities of daily living with
less stress. For example, sufficient muscular fitness will allow you to complete yard-
work with less relative effort or climb stairs more easily. Of course, improved muscular
fitness will also make recreational sport and athletic endeavors more enjoyable and
give you a competitive edge.
Muscular fitness is important for everyone throughout the lifespan. Children ben-
efit from activities that strengthen muscles such as climbing and jumping as well as
calisthenics (e.g., jumping jacks, push-ups, or other activities in which the body is
moved without needing any equipment) and more organized resistance training (25).
For adults, resistance training improves quality of life and limits the muscle losses
typically seen with aging.
In addition to promoting muscular strength, regular resistance training provides
other health benefits, including improving body composition and blood pressure (10).
Benefits of resistance training related to preventing or managing diabetes include
improving glucose levels and the body’s sensitivity to insulin (10).
Another aspect of your health that benefits from resistance training is bone strength
(1, 9). As muscles contract to lift, push, or pull a heavy object, a stress is placed on
the bone by way of connections between muscles and bones called tendons. When
a bone is exposed to this force, it responds by increasing its mass. This makes bones
stronger over time. Bone health is outlined in more detail in chapter 16.
Not to be ignored is the way resistance training can make you look and feel. Firm,
toned muscles can inspire confidence. Stronger muscles can give you a real boost as
you accomplish daily activities with greater ease and improve in competitive sport
as well. For all these reasons, resistance training is an important part of your weekly
activity plan.
Flexibility
Flexibility refers to the ability to move a joint through a full range of motion. Whether
you are focusing on your golf swing or more practical aspects of daily life such as
reaching for a high shelf in your closet, maintaining flexibility is important. Loss of
flexibility as a result of injury, disuse, or aging can limit your ability to carry out daily
activities. Flexibility can be maintained or even improved through a comprehensive
stretching program (1). Chapter 7 outlines stretches for all the muscle groups in the
body and discusses the benefits of including activities focused on improving range
of motion.
Conditions such as arthritis and joint pain can result in having difficulty moving
the joints through their normal range of motion. Although activity is beneficial in the
12
ACSM’s Complete Guide to Fitness & Health
treatment of arthritis, 38 percent of people with arthritis report no leisure-time activ-
ity (compared with about 27 percent of people without arthritis) (7). Full details on
flexibility as well as muscular and cardiorespiratory exercises for people with arthritis
and joint pain are provided in chapter 17.
Neuromotor Exercise
Neuromotor exercise training, also referred to as functional fitness training, includes
activities that improve balance, coordination, gait, agility, and one’s perception of
physical location within space (i.e., proprioception) (1). Many activities include com-
binations of neuromotor, resistance, and flexibility, for example, yoga, tai ji (tai chi),
and qigong (1).
Researchers have noted improvements in balance, agility, and muscular strength for
older adults who engage in functional fitness training. In addition, older adults lower
their risk of falling (1). Although most of the research studies have focused on older
adults, younger adults likely can reap benefits as well. Regardless of your age, reflect
on activities that occur over the normal course of the day when improved balance,
coordination, or agility would be valuable—for example, sidestepping around a puddle
on a busy sidewalk or juggling full bags of groceries when walking up stairs. Then,
consider how all the facets of neuromotor exercise training can affect enjoyment in
recreational activities or athletic endeavors. Examples are hiking with a loaded back-
pack, balancing on a surf- or skateboard, and playing basketball or soccer. It actually
becomes hard to think of activities that are not affected by functional fitness! Chapter
8 unpacks this often overlooked aspect of fitness.
Body Composition
Body composition refers to the makeup of your body. The body is made up of lean
tissue (including muscle) and fat tissue. Typically, the focus of body composition is the
relative amounts of muscle versus fat. Although the bathroom scale can help you track
your overall body weight, this measurement is general and does not reveal the amount
of fat compared to muscle. Excessive amounts of body fat are related to poor health
outcomes, and this is especially true for fat around the abdominal area (1). Chapter 18
discusses body weight management.
Whether you are looking to begin an exercise program or optimize the time you
are already investing in exercise, the upcoming chapters show you what to include as
well as how to track your progress. This book will help you balance the various fitness
components so you can maximize the benefits from your personal exercise program.
Diet and Nutrition
Choices related to what to eat and drink are made over and over throughout the day.
Determining what items to select can be a real challenge, even with the best of inten-
tions. Unfortunately, many people associate good nutrition with a restrictive diet filled
with unappealing options. This is unfortunate, as a healthy diet is one full of nutritious
and delicious foods. Note that that the word “diet” in this context refers to what you
eat, not a particular weight loss plan.
To help provide a foundation for nutritional choices, every five years the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans is updated (28). Most recently, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines
Making Healthy Lifestyle Choices 13
Q&A
Considering a typical eating pattern in the United States,
what are areas of concern?
In comparison with recommendations, about 75 percent of Americans do not consume
adequate vegetables, fruits, dairy, and oils. In contrast, added sugars, saturated fats, and
sodium are overconsumed. Overall calorie intake is another area of concern, as many
eating patterns include too many calories (28). Consuming more calories than needed
results in weight gain over time.
Advisory Committee reviewed the most current research and evidence in order to
provide updates to the 2010 Guidelines. This review was guided by two realities (29).
First, the committee noted that about two-thirds of American adults are overweight or
obese and about half have at least one preventable chronic disease (see figure 1.3 for
percentages of Americans who are obese [26], realizing that prevalence is even higher
when one considers overweight in addition to obesity). Contributing factors include
poor dietary patterns, calorie overconsumption, and physical inactivity. Second, the
committee acknowledged the personal, social, organizational, and environmental con-
text in which lifestyle choices—nutrition and physical activity—are made. Each person
has a unique frame of reference, and, within that context, can develop optimal dietary
patterns along with adequate physical activity to promote health (28).
Dietary patterns are linked to potential risk of obesity and chronic diseases, such
as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and some cancers (29). Researchers
are exploring potential relationships between dietary patterns and neurocognitive
disorders and congenital anomalies (29). Thus, one’s diet really does matter! The key
question is, what does a healthy diet look like? A healthy eating pattern includes veg-
etables, fruits, grains (with at least half being whole grains), fat-free or low-fat dairy,
and a variety of protein foods (e.g., seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes,
nuts, seeds, soy products) while limiting saturated and trans fats, added sugars, and
sodium (28). Rather than dictating a single, stringent diet pattern, these strategies can
be individualized to fit within one’s health needs, dietary preferences, and cultural

traditions. The focus is on flexibility
and combining foods in a variety
of ways to promote healthy dietary
patterns (29).
Understanding the various com-
ponents of a healthy diet is helpful
in developing nutritional patterns
that meet your body’s needs and
promote optimal health. Chapter 3
provides an overview of the various
nutrients and how each affects how
your body functions.
Sleep and Stress
Management
The previous sections have high-
lighted the myriad benefits that
are possible when one embraces a
physically active lifestyle and enjoys
healthy food selections. In addition
to these areas of physical wellness,
sleep and stress influence health
and, given the significant potential
impact, are included here.
Influence of Sleep

If you struggle with getting a good
ness.night’s sleep, you are not alone.
Chronic sleep loss or sleep disorders are estimated to affect up to 70 million people
(15). Obtaining adequate sleep—in terms of both quantity and quality—contributes to
how you feel and function. A restful night of sleep provides the energy and alertness
necessary to handle daily challenges. In contrast, the lack of adequate sleep negatively
affects productivity, relationships, and physical health.
Sleep is important for many reasons and significantly affects many dimensions of
wellness and quality of life. Sleep requirements vary from person to person, but in
general, adults typically need between 7 and 8 hours per night to feel well rested (15).
For a helpful visual on typical sleep requirements across the age spectrum see figure
1.4 (18). Although some adults can function normally on less sleep, others may require
significantly more. How can you know if you are getting enough sleep? Sleepiness
during the day is a simple but clear indicator that your body requires more sleep. Sig-
nificant sleepiness during the day suggests the need for more or better sleep, or both.
You may also benefit from tracking your sleep habits and trends (18).
Lack of sleep is more than just an annoyance. Sleep is important for the body to
function as intended; such functions include the following (15):

•
Heart rate and blood pressure naturally fluctuate during sleep to promote car-
diovascular health.
•
Cells and tissues are repaired as growth hormone is released during deep sleep.
•
Immune function is promoted with the creation of cytokines that target infections.
•
Hormones related to appetite change (leptin, which suppresses appetite, increases
while ghrelin, which stimulates appetite, decreases).
In addition, inadequate sleep can make daily tasks like learning, concentrating, and
reacting more difficult (15).
Changing behavior to obtain the sleep you need requires making a conscious
health choice. Implementing good sleep practices is key (see Tips for Better Sleep).
One common recommendation to promote better sleep is exercise. The National Sleep
Foundation has stated, simply, “Exercise is good for sleep” (17). Although some rec-

Recommendations in the past suggested that exercise near bedtime could be detrimental. However, newer guidelines encourage healthy adults to exercise at any time of day, as long as exercise does not replace necessary sleep time (18).

#### Tips for Better Sleep

Consider these tips to help promote a good night’s sleep (18):

- **Stick to a sleep schedule**, even on weekends.
- **Practice a relaxing bedtime ritual.**
- **Exercise daily.**
- **Evaluate your bedroom** to ensure ideal temperature, sound, and light.
- **Sleep on a comfortable mattress and pillows.**
- **Beware of hidden sleep stealers**, like alcohol and caffeine.
- **Turn off electronics before bed.**

The National Sleep Foundation recommends consulting with your primary care physician or a sleep professional if you experience symptoms such as:
- Sleepiness during the day or when you expect to be awake and alert
- Snoring
- Leg cramps or tingling
- Gasping or difficulty breathing during sleep
- Prolonged insomnia
- Any other symptom that prevents you from sleeping well

### Influence of Stress

"I’m stressed out." Likely, you have said this yourself or heard it from others. The reality is that everyone experiences stress at various points in life. So, what is stress? At its most basic level, stress is defined as the brain’s response to demands (16). Not all stress is the same. Different types of stress have been identified, including:
- **Acute stress**
- **Episodic acute stress**
- **Chronic stress**

**Acute stress** stems from demands and pressures resulting from recent events or even events anticipated in the near future (5). These stressors are short-term—for example, losing your car keys or handling a customer complaint at work. Common symptoms include irritability, anxiety, tension headaches, muscular tension, digestive
system problems, and other physiological responses such as higher blood pressure,
faster heart rate, sweating, and even shortness of breath or chest pain.
Episodic acute stress occurs when acute stress is experienced frequently (5). Picture
the person who has taken on too many tasks, who is always late and rushing, who
seems to move from one crisis directly into another, or who suffers from ongoing worry.
Symptoms of episodic acute stress include persistent tension headaches, migraines,
high blood pressure, chest pain, and heart disease.
Chronic stress is ongoing, grinding stress that is unrelenting for long periods of time
(5). The health conditions that result from untreated chronic stress include anxiety,
insomnia, muscle pain, high blood pressure, and a weakened immune system (6). In
addition, stress can contribute to the development of heart disease, depression, and
obesity (6).
Short-term stress reflects those situations in which you respond and then return back
to a baseline state of relaxation. Long-term stress can be more troubling as the body has
to continue in an alert state. This has been described as taking a “sprint” mechanism
intended to occur for a brief time (see Fight-or-Flight Response) and forcing the body
into a “marathon” or ongoing situation with resulting breakdown and system failure
over time (12). Stress can affect almost every body system. Examples are muscular

tension for the musculoskeletal system; diarrhea-constipation for the digestive system;
elevated stress hormones and blood sugar levels for the endocrine system; and increased
risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, or stroke for the cardiovascular system (3).
Chronic stress can bring feelings of being overloaded. Responses may be due to
positive or negative changes, and can be real or perceived (16). Common sources of
stress are money, work, the economy, family responsibilities, and personal health (4).
Do any (or all) of these ring true? Symptoms of stress reported in a recent survey
include feeling angry or irritated, feeling anxious or nervous, lacking motivation, feel-
ing fatigued, being depressed or sad, or feeling overwhelmed (4). Can you picture
yourself reacting in these ways?
Various approaches to dealing with stress have been proposed, including both
prevention and management (12). Being prepared for life situations can be helpful in
preventing stressors from having a negative impact. Of course, not all stressors can be
avoided, so management of one’s reaction is also important. One valuable tool used
routinely to help handle stress is regular participation in exercise (24). The role of exer-
cise in stress reduction is not yet clear, but active people appear to be able to buffer
stress more effectively than sedentary people do. In addition, healthy diets facilitate a
healthy state (see chapter 3 for current recommendations on healthy dietary patterns).
In addition to being active and eating well, other tools can be used to prevent or
manage stress. As you consider some of the following tips, realize that no one tool
works for all people, or even within all situations.

Fight-or-Flight Response
The fight-or-flight response is intended to be beneficial for survival when one is faced with
a threat. The body gears up to act as needed, and in doing so, turns on some areas of the
body while shutting down others that are not immediately needed. When confronted with
an acute stress (e.g., being startled by a loud sound when walking on a darkened sidewalk),
the body prepares to deal with the potential danger or to escape. The responses that prepare
the body for action include these: the heart beats faster, blood pressure increases, breathing
becomes heavy, pupils dilate, and muscles tense. At the same time the body increases the
availability of glucose and fats to burn for fuel while shutting down areas not vital in the
moment such as immune function, reproductive capacity, and digestion (12).
•
Plan your schedule. Being aware of and in charge of your schedule provides an
empowering feeling that helps to reduce the impact of stressful situations. Plan-
ning promotes effective time management.
•
Avoid procrastination. Consider how stress can be prevented when a work-related
project is completed in advance of a deadline compared with procrastination that
brings on a hectic rush to beat the cutoff date.
•
Relax with deep breathing. The process of consciously slowing your breathing
rate as you increase the depth of each breath helps to counteract the fast and
shallow breathing that is common when experiencing stress.
•
Limit alcohol consumption. Although alcohol may reduce stress temporarily, rely-
ing on alcohol to cope with stress has the opposite effect and produces more
bodily stress.
•
Talk to family and friends. Discussing stressful events with others you trust can
be beneficial both because it helps you “get it off your chest” and because you
might receive helpful recommendations.
If faced with stress that cannot be managed with basic techniques, consider getting
help from a psychologist or other licensed mental health professional (6).
Making healthy lifestyle choices can be a challenge, but developing healthy habits is
well worth the effort. Although some benefits have a long-term focus, such as promoting
heart health, others can be realized more immediately, such as stress reduction. Includ-
ing regular physical activity along with healthy nutrition promotes physical wellness.
