DIAGNOSIS
A Clinicians should use reproduction of retropatellar or peri-
patellar pain during squatting as a diagnostic test for
patellofemoral pain (PFP). Clinicians should also use perfor-
mance of other functional activities that load the patellofemoral
joint (PFJ) in a flexed position, such as stair climbing or descent,
as diagnostic tests for PFP.
B Clinicians should make the diagnosis of PFP using the fol-
lowing criteria: (1) the presence of retropatellar or peri-
patellar pain, (2) reproduction of retropatellar or peripatellar pain
with squatting, stair climbing, prolonged sitting, or other func-
tional activities loading the PFJ in a flexed position, and (3) exclu-
sion of all other conditions that may cause anterior knee pain,
including tibiofemoral pathologies.
C Clinicians may use the patellar tilt test with the presence
of hypomobility to support the diagnosis of PFP.
CLASSIFICATION
F Given the absence of a previously established valid classi-
fication system for PFP, the clinical practice guideline
group proposes a classification consisting of 4 subcategories as-
sociated with the International Classification of Functioning, Dis-
ability and Health. The proposed classification system is based
on published evidence. The subcategories are named according
to predominant impairments previously documented in people
with PFP. Clinicians may consider using the proposed impair-
ment/function-based PFP classification system to guide patient/
client management.
PFP IMPAIRMENT/FUNCTION-BASED
CLASSIFICATION SUBCATEGORIES
1. Overuse/overload without other impairment: a subcategory of
individuals with PFP may have pain primarily due to overuse/
overload. Classification into the overuse/overload without other
impairment subcategory is made with a fair level of certainty
when the patient presents with a history suggesting an increase
in magnitude and/or frequency of PFJ loading at a rate that sur-
passes the ability of his or her PFJ tissues to recover.
2. Muscle performance deficits: a subcategory of individuals
with PFP may respond favorably to hip and knee resistance
exercises. Classification into the muscle performance deficits
subcategory is made with a fair level of certainty when the
patient presents with lower extremity muscle performance
deficits in the hip and quadriceps.
3. Movement coordination deficits: a subcategory of individuals
with PFP may respond favorably to gait retraining and move-
ment re-education interventions leading to improvements in
lower extremity kinematics and pain, suggesting the impor-
tance of assessing dynamic knee valgus during movement.
The diagnosis of PFP with movement coordination deficits is
made with a fair level of certainty when the patient presents
with excessive or poorly controlled knee valgus during a dy-
namic task, but not necessarily due to weakness of the lower
extremity musculature.
4. Mobility impairments: a subcategory of individuals with
PFP may have impairments related to either hypermobile
or hypomobile structures. The diagnosis of PFP with mobil-
ity deficits is made with a fair level of certainty when the
patient presents with higher than normal foot mobility and/
or flexibility deficits of 1 or more of the following structures:
hamstrings, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, soleus, lateral reti-
naculum, or iliotibial band.
EXAMINATION – OUTCOME MEASURES: ACTIVITY
LIMITATIONS/SELF-REPORT MEASURES
A Clinicians should use the Anterior Knee Pain Scale
(AKPS), the patellofemoral pain and osteoarthritis sub-
scale of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score
(KOOS-PF), or the visual analog scale (VAS) for activity or Eng
and Pierrynowski Questionnaire (EPQ) to measure pain and func-
tion in patients with PFP. In addition, clinicians should use the
VAS for worst pain, VAS for usual pain, or the numeric pain-rating
scale (NPRS) to measure pain. Clinicians should use one of the
translations and cross-cultural adaptations with demonstrated
validity, reliability, and responsiveness to change for patients in
different countries and for those requiring questionnaires in lan-
guages other than English.
EXAMINATION – ACTIVITY LIMITATIONS/
PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES
B Clinicians should administer appropriate clinical or field
tests that reproduce pain and assess lower-limb move-
ment coordination, such as squatting, step-downs, and single-leg
squats. These tests can assess a patient’s baseline status relative
to pain, function, and disability; global knee function; and chang-
es in status throughout the course of treatment.
EXAMINATION – ACTIVITY LIMITATIONS/
PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENT MEASURES
C When evaluating a patient with PFP over an episode of
care, clinicians may assess body structure and function,
including measures of patellar provocation, patellar mobility, foot
position, hip and thigh muscle strength, and muscle length.

rearfoot-strike runners), cuing to increase running cadence, or
cuing to reduce peak hip adduction while running for runners
with PFP.
INTERVENTIONS – BLOOD FLOW RESTRICTION
TRAINING PLUS HIGH-REPETITION KNEE-
TARGETED EXERCISE THERAPY
F Clinicians may use blood flow restriction plus high-repeti-
tion knee exercise therapy, while monitoring for adverse
events, for those with limiting painful resisted knee extension.
INTERVENTIONS – NEEDLING THERAPIES
A Clinicians should not use dry needling for the treatment of
patients with PFP.
C Clinicians may use acupuncture to reduce pain in patients
with PFP. However, caution should be exercised with this
recommendation, as the superiority of acupuncture over placebo
or sham treatments is unknown. This recommendation should
only be incorporated in settings where acupuncture is within the
scope of practice of physical therapy.
INTERVENTIONS – MANUAL THERAPY
AS A STAND-ALONE TREATMENT
A Clinicians should not use manual therapy, including lum-
bar, knee, or patellofemoral manipulation/mobilization, in
isolation for patients with PFP.
INTERVENTIONS – BIOPHYSICAL AGENTS
B Clinicians should not use biophysical agents, including ul-
trasound, cryotherapy, phonophoresis, iontophoresis,
electrical stimulation, and therapeutic laser, for the treatment of
patients with PFP.
INTERVENTIONS – PATIENT EDUCATION
F Clinicians may include specific patient education on load
management, body-weight management when appropri-
ate, the importance of adherence to active treatments like exer-
cise therapy, biomechanics that may contribute to relative
overload of the PFJ, the evidence for various treatment options,
and kinesiophobia. Patient education may improve compliance
and adherence to active management and self-management
strategies, and is unlikely to have adverse effects.
INTERVENTIONS – COMBINED INTERVENTIONS
A Clinicians should combine physical therapy interventions
for the treatment of patients with PFP, which results in su-
perior outcomes compared with no treatment, flat shoe inserts,
or foot orthoses alone in the short and medium term. Exercise
therapy is the critical component and should be the focus in any
INTERVENTIONS – SPECIFIC MODES
OF EXERCISE THERAPY
A Clinicians should include exercise therapy with combined
hip- and knee-targeted exercises to reduce pain and im-
prove patient-reported outcomes and functional performance in
the short, medium, and long term. Hip-targeted exercise therapy
should target the posterolateral hip musculature. Knee-targeted
exercise therapy includes either weight-bearing (resisted squats)
or non–weight-bearing (resisted knee extension) exercise, as both
exercise techniques target the knee musculature. Preference to
hip-targeted exercise over knee-targeted exercise may be given in
the early stages of treatment of PFP. Overall, the combination of
hip- and knee-targeted exercises is preferred over solely knee-tar-
geted exercises to optimize outcomes in patients with PFP.
INTERVENTIONS – PATELLAR TAPING
B Clinicians may use tailored patellar taping in combination
with exercise therapy to assist in immediate pain reduc-
tion, and to enhance outcomes of exercise therapy in the short
term (4 weeks). Importantly, taping techniques may not be bene-
ficial in the longer term or when added to more intensive physical
therapy. Taping applied with the aim of enhancing muscle func-
tion is not recommended.
INTERVENTIONS – PATELLOFEMORAL
KNEE ORTHOSES (BRACING)
B Clinicians should not prescribe patellofemoral knee
orthoses, including braces, sleeves, or straps, for patients
with PFP.
INTERVENTIONS – FOOT ORTHOSES
A Clinicians should prescribe prefabricated foot orthoses
for patients with greater than normal pronation to reduce
pain, but only in the short term (up to 6 weeks). If prescribed,
foot orthoses should be combined with an exercise therapy pro-
gram. There is insufficient evidence to recommend custom foot
orthoses over prefabricated foot orthoses.
INTERVENTIONS – BIOFEEDBACK
B Clinicians should not use electromyography-based bio-
feedback on medial vastii activity to augment knee-target-
ed (quadriceps) exercise therapy for the treatment of PFP.
B Clinicians should not use visual biofeedback on lower ex-
tremity alignment during hip- and knee-targeted exercises
for the treatment of patients with PFP.
INTERVENTIONS – RUNNING GAIT RETRAINING
C Clinicians may use gait retraining consisting of multiple
sessions of cuing to adopt a forefoot-strike pattern (for

combined intervention approach. Interventions to consider com-
bining with exercise therapy include foot orthoses, patellar taping,
patellar mobilizations, and lower-limb stretching.

Introduction
AIM OF THE GUIDELINES
The Academy of Orthopaedic Physical Therapy of the Ameri-
can Physical Therapy Association (APTA), Inc has an ongo-
ing effort to create evidence-based clinical practice guidelines
(CPGs) for orthopaedic physical therapy management of pa-
tients with musculoskeletal impairments described in the
World Health Organization’s International Classification of
Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF).319
The objectives of these clinical guidelines are as follows:
• Describe evidence-based physical therapy practice, includ-
ing diagnosis, prognosis, intervention, and assessment of
outcome, for musculoskeletal disorders commonly man-
aged by orthopaedic physical therapists
• Classify and define common musculoskeletal conditions
using the World Health Organization’s terminology related
to impairments of body function and body structure, activ-
ity limitations, and participation restrictions
• Identify interventions supported by current best evidence
to address impairments of body function and structure, ac-
tivity limitations, and participation restrictions associated
with common musculoskeletal conditions
• Identify appropriate outcome measures to assess changes
resulting from physical therapy interventions in body func-
tion and structure as well as in activity and participation of
the individual
• Provide a description to policy makers, using internation-
ally accepted terminology, of the practice of orthopaedic
physical therapists
• Provide information for payers and claims reviewers re-
garding the practice of orthopaedic physical therapy for
common musculoskeletal conditions
• Create a reference publication for orthopaedic physical
therapy clinicians, academic instructors, clinical instruc-
tors, students, interns, residents, and fellows regarding the
best current practice of orthopaedic physical therapy
STATEMENT OF INTENT
These guidelines are not intended to be construed or to serve
as a standard of medical care. Standards of care are deter-
mined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individ-
ual patient and are subject to change as scientific knowledge
and technology advance and patterns of care evolve. These
parameters of practice should be considered guidelines only.
Adherence to them will not ensure a successful outcome in
every patient, nor should they be construed as including all
proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable meth-
ods of care aimed at the same results. The ultimate judgment
regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan
must be made based on clinician experience and expertise in
light of the clinical presentation of the patient, the available
evidence, available diagnostic and treatment options, and the
patient’s values, expectations, and preferences. However, we
suggest that significant departures from accepted guidelines
should be documented in the patient’s medical records at the
time the relevant clinical decision is made.
SCOPE AND RATIONALE OF THE GUIDELINE
Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is a common musculoskeletal-
related condition that is characterized by insidious onset of
poorly defined pain, localized to the anterior retropatellar
and/or peripatellar region of the knee.80 The onset of symp-
toms can be slow or acutely develop with a worsening of pain
accompanying lower-limb loading activities (eg, squatting,
prolonged sitting, ascending/descending stairs, jumping, or
running, especially with hills).154,234,254 Symptoms can restrict
participation in physical activity, sports, and work.74 Symp-
toms can recur and can persist for years.74 Patients with PFP
symptoms frequently present to health care professionals for
diagnosis and treatment.74,277 This CPG will allow physical
therapists and other rehabilitation specialists to stay up to
date with evolving PFP knowledge and practices, and help
them to make evidence-based treatment decisions.166
Content experts were appointed by the Academy of Ortho-
paedic Physical Therapy, APTA, Inc to conduct a review of
the literature and to develop a PFP CPG as indicated by the
current state of the evidence in the field. The authors of this
guideline worked with research librarians with expertise in
systematic reviews to perform a systematic search. The search
was for concepts associated with PFP in articles published
since 1960 related to classification, examination, and inter-
vention strategies, consistent with previous guideline devel-
opment methods related to ICF classification.184 Briefly, the
following databases were searched from 1960 to May 2018:
MEDLINE (PubMed; 1960 to date), Scopus (Elsevier BV;
1960 to date), CINAHL (EBSCO; 1960 to date), SPORTDis-
cus (EBSCO; 1960 to date), Cochrane Library (Wiley; 1960
to date). See APPENDIX A for full search strategies and APPENDIX B
for search dates and results, available at www.jospt.org.

The authors declared relationships and developed a conflict
management plan, which included submitting a conflict of
interest form to the Academy of Orthopaedic Physical Thera-
py, APTA, Inc. Articles that were authored by a reviewer were
assigned to an alternate reviewer. Funding was provided to
the CPG development team for travel and expenses for CPG
development training. The CPG development team main-
tained editorial independence.
Articles contributing to recommendations were reviewed
based on specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, with the
goal of identifying evidence relevant to physical therapist
clinical decision making for adult persons with PFP. The title
and abstract of each article were reviewed independently by
2 members of the CPG development team for inclusion. See
APPENDIX C for inclusion and exclusion criteria, available at
www.jospt.org. Full-text review was then similarly conducted
to obtain the final set of articles for contribution to recom-
mendations. The team leader (D.S.L.) provided the final deci-
sion for discrepancies that were not resolved by the review
team. See APPENDIX D for a flow chart of articles and APPENDIX E
for articles included in recommendations by topic, available
at www.jospt.org. For selected relevant topics that were not
appropriate to the development of recommendations, such
as incidence and imaging, articles were not subject to the
systematic review process and were not included in the flow
chart. Evidence tables for this CPG are available on the Clini-
cal Practice Guidelines page of the Academy of Orthopaedic
Physical Therapy, APTA, Inc website (www.orthopt.org).
This guideline was issued in 2019 based on the published
literature up to May 2018. This guideline will be considered
for review in 2024, or sooner if new evidence becomes avail-
able. Any updates to the guideline in the interim period will
be noted on the Academy of Orthopaedic Physical Therapy,
APTA, Inc website (www.orthopt.org).
LEVELS OF EVIDENCE
Individual clinical research articles were graded accord-
ing to criteria adapted from the Centre for Evidence-Based
Medicine, Oxford, United Kingdom for diagnostic, prospec-
tive, and therapeutic studies.229 In 3 teams of 2, each review-
er independently assigned a level of evidence and evaluated
the quality of each article using a critical appraisal tool. See
APPENDICES F and G for the evidence table and details on pro-
cedures used for assigning levels of evidence, available at
www.jospt.org. The evidence update was organized from
highest level of evidence to lowest level. An abbreviated
version of the grading system is provided as follows.
I Evidence obtained from high-quality diagnostic studies, prospec-
tive studies, randomized controlled trials, or systematic reviews
II
Evidence obtained from lesser-quality diagnostic studies, pro-
spective studies, systematic reviews, or randomized controlled
trials (eg, weaker diagnostic criteria and reference standards,
improper randomization, no blinding, less than 80% follow-up)
III Case-control studies or retrospective studies
IV Case series
V Expert opinion
STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE AND GRADES OF RECOMMENDATION
The strength of the evidence supporting the recommendations
was graded according to the previously established methods
provided below. Each team developed recommendations based
on the strength of evidence, including how directly the studies
addressed the question in the PFP population. In developing
their recommendations, the authors considered the strengths
and limitations of the body of evidence, and the health ben-
efits, side effects, and risks of tests and interventions.
GRADES OF RECOMMENDATION STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE
A
Strong evidence A preponderance of level I and/or level II
studies support the recommendation. This
must include at least 1 level I study
B
Moderate
evidence
A single high-quality randomized controlled
trial or a preponderance of level II studies
support the recommendation
C
Weak evidence A single level II study or a preponderance of
level III and IV studies, including statements
of consensus by content experts, support the
recommendation
D
Conflicting
evidence
Higher-quality studies conducted on this
topic disagree with respect to their conclu-
sions. The recommendation is based on
these conflicting studies
E
Theoretical/
foundational
evidence
A preponderance of evidence from animal or
cadaver studies, from conceptual models/
principles, or from basic science/bench
research supports this recommendation
F
Expert opinion Best practice based on the clinical experi-
ence of the guidelines development team
supports this recommendation
DESCRIPTION OF GUIDELINE VALIDATION
Identified reviewers who are experts in PFP management and
rehabilitation reviewed this CPG content and methods for in-
tegrity and accuracy and to ensure that they fully represent
the condition. Any comments, suggestions, or feedback from
the expert reviewers were delivered to authors and editors to
consider and make appropriate revisions. These guidelines
were also posted for public comment and review on the www.

orthopt.org website, and a notification of this posting was
sent to the members of the Academy of Orthopaedic Physical
Therapy, APTA, Inc. Any comments, suggestions, and feed-
back gathered from public commentary were sent to authors
and editors to consider and make appropriate revisions in the
guideline. In addition, a panel of consumer/patient represen-
tatives and external stakeholders, such as claims reviewers,
medical coding experts, academic educators, clinical educa-
tors, physician specialists, and researchers, also reviewed the
guideline and provided feedback and recommendations that
were given to authors and editors for further consideration
and revisions. Last, a panel of consumer/patient represen-
tatives and external stakeholders and a panel of experts in
physical therapy practice guideline methodology annually re-
view the Academy of Orthopaedic Physical Therapy, APTA,
Inc’s ICF-based CPG policies and provide feedback and com-
ments to the Clinical Practice Guidelines Coordinator and
editors to improve the APTA’s guideline development and
implementation processes.
DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION TOOLS
In addition to publishing these guidelines in the Journal
of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy (JOSPT), these
guidelines will be posted on CPG areas of both the JOSPT
and the Academy of Orthopaedic Physical Therapy, APTA,
Inc websites, which are free-access website areas, and sub-
mitted to be available for free access on the ECRI Guidelines
Trust website (https://guidelines.ecri.org). The implemen-
tation tools planned to be available for patients, clinicians,

ORGANIZATION OF THE GUIDELINE
For each topic of Impairment/Function-Based Diagnosis,
Examination, and Interventions, a synthesis of the recent lit-
erature, with the corresponding evidence levels, is presented.
Each topic concludes with an evidence summary or recom-
mendation and its grade. At the conclusion of the CPG, we
provide a decision tree model to illustrate clinical decision
making using the evidence and recommendations.

Patellofemoral pain is not a self-limiting condition.254 Previ-
ously, PFP was considered a condition that is commonplace
in adolescents and that would eventually resolve over time.225
However, 50% to 56% of adolescents report persistent knee
pain 2 years after their initial diagnosis.244,246 This can have a
substantial impact on quality of life and burden of living with
PFP, such as loss of physical function, loss of self-identity,
pain-related confusion and fear, and concern for the future.266
PATHOANATOMICAL FEATURES
The patellofemoral joint (PFJ) comprises the articulation be-
tween the patella and the trochlear groove of the femur. The
patella is a large sesamoid bone embedded in the quadriceps
extensor mechanism. The roles of the patella are to increase
the moment arm of the quadriceps muscles, provide bony
protection to the distal joint surfaces of the femoral condyles
when the knee is flexed, and prevent damaging compressive
forces on the quadriceps tendon with resisted knee extension.
Clinical Presentation
Patellofemoral pain is a common musculoskeletal-related
condition that is characterized by insidious onset of poorly
defined pain quality localized to the anterior retropatellar
and/or peripatellar region of the knee.80 The onset of symp-
toms can be slow or acutely develop, with a worsening of pain
with lower-limb loading (eg, squatting, prolonged sitting, as-
cending/descending stairs, jumping, or running, especially
with hills).154,234,254 While many pathoanatomic correlates,
such as internal derangement or cartilage softening, have
been offered from as early as 1928,106 all are poorly associated
with symptoms.94,254,288,291 Therefore, diagnosis is based on a
cluster of signs and symptoms after ruling out other patho-
anatomic diagnoses.205 Because there is typically a progres-
sive, insidious onset of symptoms, diagnosis is often delayed,
and describing the typical clinical course is difficult.
Pain
Collins et al61 conducted a retrospective review of 4 separate
studies on the presence of symptoms in 459 individuals with
PFP. They found that a large majority of these individuals re-
ported at least some difficulty with squatting (93.7%), stair
negotiation (91.2%), and running (90.8%).61 People with PFP
tend to ascend and descend stairs with reduced knee flexion,
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
Impairment/Function-Based
Diagnosis
PREVALENCE AND INCIDENCE
Prevalence ranges from 3% to 85% for idiopathic anterior
knee pain (AKP) or PFP and its associated diagnoses,41,207,216
with a prevalence of 25% being the most frequently cited.41
An analysis of the PearlDiver record database (a large na-
tional database of orthopaedic conditions) reported a preva-
lence of PFP diagnoses between 1.5% and 7.3% of all patients
seeking medical care.119
Patellofemoral pain occurs across the life span, from young
children to older sedentary individuals.41 The highest prev-
alence of PFP appears to be observed in those between 12
and 19 years of age,41,310 but may be dependent on activity
level and environmental context. However, these percent-
ages are in contrast to the PearlDiver data analysis, which
reported the highest percentage of PFP diagnosis in the
50-to-59-year age group.119 The discrepancy in prevalence
related to age may be due to an environmental context,
such as treatment in a sports clinic versus in a general
practice office.119
Varying differences in prevalence by sex have been reported.
Glaviano et al119 reported that 55% of patients with PFP in
the PearlDiver database were female. Boling et al32 reported
a prevalence of 15% in female naval cadets, compared to 12%
in male naval cadets, at the US Naval Academy, whereas Lak-
stein et al170 reported a prevalence of 2.39% in female Israel
Defense Force recruits compared to 4.56% in male Israel
Defense Force recruits. The overall incidence rate for PFP in
US naval cadets was 22/1000 person-years,32 and in military
recruits was 0.22/1000 training hours.151 The incidence rate
for PFP in US naval cadets was greater in women compared
to men (33/1000 person-years and 15/1000 person-years,
respectively).32 In adolescent female athletes, the cumula-
tive incidence risk and rate for the development of new uni-
lateral PFP were 9.66 per 100 athletes and 1.09 per 1000
athletic exposures, respectively.203 Tenforde et al278 reported
a lifetime prevalence of PFP in high school runners to be
21% in females and 16% in males. The recurrence of PFP is
alarmingly high, with reports of 70% to 90% having recur-
rent symptoms.270 Additionally, recent reports indicate that
more than 50% of individuals diagnosed with PFP will report
unfavorable outcomes 5 to 8 years following enrollment into
a clinical trial.174

mon in individuals with PFP in the military. The results of
the meta-analysis by Lankhorst et al173 suggested that quad-
riceps strength, as measured with a dynamometer, was con-
siderably less when compared to healthy control individuals.
Quadriceps atrophy is also a common finding in individuals
with PFP, but only when it is evaluated by imaging, not by
girth or visual assessment.116 Quadriceps atrophy is consistent
across the vastii musculature (ie, not isolated to the vastus
medialis oblique musculature).116 Thomeé and colleagues283
found quadriceps inhibition (inability of the central nervous
system to fully activate the quadriceps) of roughly 18% when
assessed with surface electromyography (EMG), suggesting
that at least some of the loss of quadriceps strength is due
to inhibited central neural drive. This may be partly due to
the pain generated from the PFJ through arthrogenic inhi-
bition. With respect to quadriceps atrophy and inhibition,
it is important to note that all studies listed above included
individuals with current signs and symptoms of PFP.
Decreased Hip Force Production
People with PFP have weakness of the hip abductors, exten-
sors, and external rotators.194,241,286 Rate of force development
of the hip abductors and extensors is also reduced in people
with PFP.214 However, in a systematic review with meta-anal-
ysis, Rathleff et al245 attempted to determine whether isomet-
ric hip strength was a definitive cause or a result of PFP by
comparing outcomes of 21 cross-sectional and 3 prospective
studies.245 The authors of the 3 prospective studies reported
no association between hip strength and the development of
PFP. The cross-sectional studies indicated small differences
between people with and without PFP for hip abduction, ex-
tension, external rotation, internal rotation, and adduction.
There is a strong possibility that hip weakness is a result of
PFP, and not a direct cause of PFP.245
Biomechanics
Altered biomechanics are commonly observed during func-
tional movements in people with PFP. People with PFP may
walk, run,89,238 and negotiate stairs87 with reduced knee flexion
compared to healthy controls, which may represent a com-
pensation pattern. Clinically, patients with PFP often present
with an increased frontal plane projection angle (FPPA; a
2-dimensional surrogate for the 3-D measures of hip adduc-
tion, hip internal rotation, knee abduction, and knee external
rotation) during single-leg squat (SLS)134,307 and during a hop
landing.134 Athletes who tend to move excessively into great-
er FPPAs during a jump landing are more likely to develop
PFP.142 Distally, altered foot and ankle biomechanics are not
consistently observed in people with PFP.240
Pain Sensitization
A systematic review by De Oliveira Silva et al88 examined the
and there is some debate as to whether this is consistently seen
in level walking.72 More than half (54.4%) of people with PFP
reported pain with prolonged sitting; another 26.4% reported
pain with sitting after exercise. Only 19.2% of people could sit
without pain.61 Pain with prolonged sitting had low to moder-
ate diagnostic accuracy in an earlier systematic review.64
A systematic review of reviews concluded that AKP produced
by functional tasks such as squatting, stair climbing, and sit-
ting with flexed knees is currently the best diagnostic indica-
tor of PFP.222
Sandow and Goodfellow254 found less frequent reports of
symptoms with functional tasks in their long-term follow-up
of about 4 years, with 50% of participants reporting PFP on
a weekly or more frequent basis. Half of the cohort reported
pain with stair climbing and 39% with sport participation at
the 4-year follow-up. Although symptoms of PFP may become
less frequent over time, 94% still reported some degree of PFP,
either at rest or with other activities such as walking. Pain dur-
ing running was not assessed.254 Sandow and Goodfellow254
also reported that nearly 50% of their cohort had bilateral PFP.
People with PFP demonstrate some common clinical char-
acteristics. Often, patients report pain with palpation of the
distal pole or medial aspect of the patella, the medial plica,
and the medial femoral condyle.113,210 There may be pain with
grinding or compressing of the patella.
Anthropometrics
Patient characteristics, anthropometrics, and patellofemoral
alignment are often postulated as important factors in the
development of PFP. However, a recent systematic review of
observational studies concluded that age, body mass, height,
and body mass index (BMI) were not risk factors for the de-
velopment of PFP.173 Specific to lower extremity structure, the
quadriceps angle (Q angle), assessed either in weight bearing
or non–weight bearing, was not a risk factor for the develop-
ment of PFP.173,223
Patellofemoral pain is often believed to be related to excessive
foot pronation; however, to date, only 1 study has shown that
greater navicular drop was associated with, and predictive of,
the development of PFP in a military cohort.34 Overall, exces-
sive foot pronation does not appear to be a feature across
studies examining individuals with PFP.
Decreased Thigh Force Production
Compared with healthy, matched controls, people who devel-
op PFP have weaker quadriceps, as measured by a dynamom-
eter. However, quadriceps weakness has only been found to
be a risk factor for the development of PFP in military popu-
lations.173 Impaired lower extremity muscle function is com-

In an exploratory study, Lankhorst et al174 determined that
female participants and those with a longer duration of
symptoms (greater than 6 months) were more likely to report
worse outcomes. In the individuals who received medical ad-
vice from a physician, 68% reported no improvement after 3
months, and 54% reported no improvement after 12 months.
PFP and Patellofemoral Osteoarthritis
A link between PFP and patellofemoral osteoarthritis
(PFOA) has been suggested.69,74,140,141,320 Patellofemoral pain
and PFOA have similar presentations, including location of
pain, quadriceps and hip muscle weakness, and reported pain
and difficulty with similar activities (eg, stair climbing and
prolonged sitting). However, long-term prospective data are
presently lacking to confirm or refute this link,69,320 with a
recent consensus statement concluding that insufficient evi-
dence exists to conclusively link a past history of PFP with
PFOA.293 However, there is retrospective evidence of a rela-
tionship between previous history of PFP and the presence
of PFOA later in life. Thomas et al282 conducted a systematic
review examining the link between a history of PFP as an
adolescent or young adult and subsequent development of
PFOA. This systematic review included 6 prospective studies,
follow-ups of 5 case series and 1 randomized controlled trial
(RCT), and 1 retrospective case-control study. Only the retro-
spective study specifically aimed to examine the link between
PFP and PFOA later in life.285 The prospective studies were
of low quality due to small sample size, low follow-up rates,
inclusion of PFP due to trauma, and lack of control groups.
The evidence for a link between PFP and development of
PFOA was limited to 1 retrospective case-control study by
Utting et al,285 who compared the history of individuals who
had a patellofemoral arthroplasty for PFOA to those who had
a unicompartmental tibiofemoral arthroplasty. Those under-
going patellofemoral arthroplasty (n = 118) more frequently
recalled a history of PFP (22% versus 6%), patellar instability
(14% versus 1%), and patellar trauma (16% versus 6%) com-
pared to those undergoing unicompartmental tibiofemoral
arthroplasty (n = 116).
Conchie et al62 conducted a retrospective case-control study
to determine the prevalence of AKP and patellar dislocation
in persons undergoing patellofemoral arthroplasty for se-
vere, isolated PFOA (n = 190) compared to persons (n = 445)
undergoing unicompartmental tibiofemoral arthroplasty
for severe medial tibiofemoral osteoarthritis (OA). Of these
groups, 111 (58%) people with PFOA and 234 (53%) people
in the unicompartmental tibiofemoral arthroplasty control
group participated. A multivariate binary regression analy-
sis found significantly greater association between adolescent
AKP and PFOA (odds ratio [OR] = 7.5; 95% CI: 1.51, 36.94).
Additional significant associations were found for history of
patellar dislocation (OR = 3.2; 95% CI: 1.25, 8.18), patellar
association of pain sensitization in patients with PFP (n =
315). They reviewed 9 studies that included 315 participants
with PFP and 164 healthy controls. They reported that in 5
studies, patients with PFP were more sensitized (lower pres-
sure pain thresholds) to a local pressure stimulus (standard-
ized mean difference [SMD], –1.12; 95% confidence interval
[CI]: –1.48, –0.75) and a stimulus at a remote location (SMD,
–0.93; 95% CI: –1.19, –0.67) compared to healthy controls.
However, patients with PFP were no more sensitive to heat
or cold compared to healthy controls.
Rate of Recurrence of PFP
Based on the results of a few longitudinal studies, PFP is as-
sociated with a high rate of chronicity, even after nonsurgical
care. Sandow and Goodfellow254 followed 54 adolescent girls
for 2 to 8 years after diagnosis of PFP. At an average of about
4 years after diagnosis, 94% were still experiencing some
form of pain, with less than half (46%) having a decrease
in pain severity. Nimon and colleagues211 followed this same
cohort via questionnaires for 14 to 20 years. At the long-term
follow-up, only 22% had no pain, but 71% had less pain than
at initial presentation. From the individuals who completed
the questionnaires at both 2 to 8 years and 14 to 20 years, the
authors concluded that there are likely to be improvements in
50% of cases within the first 4 years, and an additional 23%
in the next 12; however, they were not able to predict who
would not improve.211
Blond and Hansen29 reported an average of 6-year follow-up
of 250 athletes diagnosed with PFP who were prescribed a
self-training program for the lower extremity. About a quar-
ter (27%) of athletes experienced complete pain relief, and an
additional 38% had decreased pain, leaving 35% with pain
that was either unchanged or worse.
Kannus and Niittymäki154 attempted to identify predictors
of people who would benefit from nonsurgical treatment of
PFP. Of the 49 patients treated with avoidance of aggravating
activity, quadriceps isometric exercises, stretching exercises,
and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, 36 (73%) experi-
enced resolution of symptoms.152 Only being younger was
predictive of improving pain, Lysholm scores, and activity.154
Overall, these results indicate that attempts to improve the
function of the quadriceps and remove aggravating factors
are likely beneficial in the treatment of PFP.152 At a 7-year
follow-up of these same individuals, there were few changes
in patient-reported and performance-based functions (quad-
riceps strength, squatting, hopping, duck walking); however,
physical signs of pain with patellar compression, Clarke’s test,
and crepitus during patellar compression increased from 6
months to 7 years.153 Finally, about a quarter of individuals
developed symptoms in the contralateral knee during the
7-year follow-up.153

II Boling et al32 reported that female US Navy cadets
were 2.23 times (95% CI: 1.19, 4.20) more likely to
develop PFP compared with male US Navy cadets.
II Hall et al129 conducted a retrospective cohort study
on the relationship between sports specialization
and the risk of developing PFP in young female ath-
letes. An overall PFP incidence of 28% was reported in 546
female adolescent basketball, soccer, and volleyball players
consisting of 357 multisport and 189 single-sport athletes.
Participation in a single sport (basketball, soccer, or volley-
ball) was associated with a greater incidence of cumulative
PFP disorders (incidence rate ratio = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.0, 2.2)
compared to participation in multiple sports.
IV van Middelkoop et al294 investigated differences in
characteristics between adolescents (n = 20) and
adults (n = 44) with PFP. At baseline, adolescents
with lower BMI had greater quadriceps strength and report-
ed more bilateral PFP symptoms compared to adults. Both
groups had similar hip strength and reported similar levels
of pain at rest and during activity and self-reported knee
function. At 1-year follow-up, adolescents and adults had
similar levels of pain, self-reported knee function, and medi-
cal consumption. Only 25% of adolescents and 23% of adults
reported functional recovery at 1 year.
Local Factors
I Seven prospective studies were included in a sys-
tematic review by Pappas and Wong-Tom.223 Low
knee extension isometric strength was predictive
of the development of PFP according to a meta-analysis
from 2 studies. The Q angle, static knee valgus, and dy-
namic measures of knee valgus were not predictive of PFP.
An additional cross-sectional study that was not reported
in the systematic review also reported no association be-
tween Q angle and peak knee abduction moment in healthy
runners with PFP.224
II A prospective study of college-aged physical educa-
tion students found an association of decreased
quadriceps flexibility, shorter reflex response time
of the vastus medialis oblique muscle, reduction of vertical
jump height, and higher than normal medial patellar mobil-
ity with occurrence of PFP.313
III A literature review suggests that weakness in func-
tional testing was coincident with tightness of the
hamstring muscles, quadriceps muscles, and ilio-
tibial band with AKP conditions (which included tendinopa-
thies).298 No coincident relationship was reported between
patellar mobility and PFP in the articles retrieved in their
search.
instability (OR = 3.5; 95% CI: 1.62, 7.42), and previous sur-
gery (adjusted OR = 3.5; 95% CI: 1.75, 7.14).
Hinman and colleagues137 compared the presence of radio-
graphic PFOA and tibiofemoral OA in 224 individuals who
had chronic PFP who were older than 40 years of age. Isolated
PFOA was present in 25% of the sample, combined PFOA and
tibiofemoral OA was present in 44%, and isolated tibiofemo-
ral OA was present in only 1% of the sample. Only 30% of this
sample with chronic PFP had no evidence of radiographic OA.137
Schiphof et al255 examined 1518 knees of women over 45 years
of age that had either no OA or only early signs of OA of the
PFJ. Cartilage defects were present in 15% of these PFJs, 25%
had osteophytes, 13% had cysts, and 19% had bone marrow
lesions. A history of PFP (25% of the sample) was associated
with current cartilage lesions, cartilage cysts, and bone mar-
row lesions.255
Summary
Patellofemoral pain has a variable clinical presentation but
is generally associated with AKP exacerbations when loading
the PFJ in squatting, participation in sports, stair negotiation,
prolonged sitting, and walking. Decreased knee extensor and
hip musculature strength is associated with PFP compared
to those without PFP. The most frequently cited predictors
of poor outcomes are longer duration of symptoms before
intervention, overall poorer function, and worse pain. Nega-
tive psychological stress and altered pain sensitization were
present in patients with PFP. For the majority of patients,
the “educate and wait” approach of avoiding pain-provoking
activities is not effective in improving pain and function in
the short, medium, or long term. It appears that PFP and
PFOA may be related; however, there is insufficient evidence
to directly state a cause-and-effect relationship.
RISK FACTORS
The etiology of PFP is poorly understood and considered to
be multifactorial. Frequently, development and persistence of
symptoms are attributed to proximal, distal, or local factors
that increase or alter load/stress to the PFJ, and there is a
large body of research in this area. More recently, nonphysical
influences on symptoms have been explored, with emerging
evidence that factors such as pain sensitization and psycho-
logical state may play roles in PFP.
Demographics
I A systematic review with a meta-analysis of 7 pro-
spective studies reported on anthropometrics and
the development of PFP.223 In 6 studies with 905
healthy controls and 177 people with PFP, height, weight, and
percentage body fat were not predictive of PFP.

Muscle Strength
II Giles et al116 performed a systematic review of 10
studies (2 RCTs, 8 cross-sectional studies) with
meta-analysis of 7 studies on quadriceps muscle
size. For quadriceps girth measurements, the SMD between
the limb with PFP and the control limb was –0.084 (95% CI:
–0.44, 0.27), indicating no differences. For imaging measure-
ments of quadriceps muscle size, the SMD was –0.44 (95%
CI: –0.86, –0.029), indicating quadriceps atrophy in the limb
with PFP.
II Van Tiggelen et al295 investigated the role of muscle
strength as a predisposing factor in the develop-
ment of PFP. Thirty-one out of 96 male military
recruits developed PFP after a strenuous military training
program (8-12 h/d for 6 weeks). Recruits who developed PFP
were shorter in height or had lower knee extensor strength
compared to those who did not develop PFP.
III In a case-control study, 25 women with PFP and 25
asymptomatic women with PFP had between 11.1%
and 30.7% inferior knee extensor, hip extensor, hip
abductor, and hip external rotator strength compared to as-
ymptomatic women. Women with PFP had greater center-of-
pressure (COP) displacement and velocity during a step-up
and step-down task compared to the asymptomatic
women.85
III Guney et al124 investigated the quadriceps-to-ham-
strings strength ratio in 44 women with unilateral
PFP (using the contralateral limb as the control).
At 60°/s and 180°/s for the concentric quadriceps-to-con-
centric hamstrings ratio, the limb with PFP had mean ± SD
ratios of 1.18 ± 0.21 and 1.02 ± 0.44, respectively, and the
control limb had ratios of 1.36 ± 0.57 and 1.35 ± 0.32, re-
spectively. At 60°/s and 180°/s for the eccentric quadriceps-
to-concentric hamstrings ratio, the limb with PFP had
ratios of 1.19 ± 0.23 and 2.56 ± 0.49, respectively, and the
control limb had ratios of 1.55 ± 0.59 and 2.86 ± 0.91,
respectively.
III A cross-sectional analysis of an RCT was performed
to identify characteristics of men and women who
responded to a 6-week hip- or knee-based rehabili-
tation program. Improvement was defined by either a mini-
mum of a 2-cm reduction on a visual analog scale (VAS) for
pain or at least an 8-point improvement in function on the
Anterior Knee Pain Scale (AKPS). Men and women improved
after completing both the hip- and the knee-based exercise
programs. Those who responded to either exercise program
had lower baseline hip and knee muscle strength compared
to the nonresponders.31
III Hoglund et al139 compared isometric hip strength
in 36 men with and 36 men without PFP. Men with
PFP had weaker hip extensors, but there were no
differences between groups in hip abductor or external rota-
tor strength.
Patellofemoral Characteristics
III Carlson et al44 used magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) to investigate the distance between the tibial
tubercle and the femoral trochlear groove in a co-
hort of 50 knees (38 participants) with PFP and 60 (56 par-
ticipants) asymptomatic knees. The distance between the
tibial tubercle and the trochlear groove in fully extended
knees for participants with PFP was a mean ± SD of 13.0 ±
3.6 mm, compared to 10.8 ± 3.0 mm for asymptomatic con-
trols. Thirty percent of participants with PFP had distances
between the tibial tubercle and the trochlear groove greater
than 15 mm, compared to 5% of asymptomatic controls.
III Aysin et al12 used MRI to investigate the trochlear
sulcus angle, the trochlear sulcus depth, a ratio of
patellar tendon length to the longest diagonal di-
ameter of the patella (Insall-Salvati ratio), and lateral patel-
lofemoral angle in 38 people with PFP and chondromalacia
patellae (CMP) diagnosed by imaging. Although those with
more advanced CMP reported higher pain severity and lower
knee function compared to those with early CMP, there were
no differences in MRI measures.
Proximal Factors
I Trunk and hip mechanics and impairments have
been implicated as factors in the development and
persistence of PFP. Based on 3 high-quality pro-
spective studies included in the systematic review by Rathleff
et al,245 there is moderate to strong evidence that no associa-
tion exists between lower isometric strength of the hip abduc-
tors, extensors, external rotators, or internal rotators and the
risk of developing PFP. In contrast, the results of multiple (n
= 21) cross-sectional studies from this same systematic re-
view provide moderate to strong evidence that individuals
with PFP have lower isometric strength of the hip
musculature.245
II Among studies that have exclusively looked at run-
ners, the contribution of hip weakness is not clear.
One systematic review of 2 cross-sectional studies
and 1 prospective study found conflicting results for the rela-
tionship between hip abductor weakness and the presence of
PFP.199 A different systematic review of cross-sectional and
case-control studies reported a reduction in duration of glu-
teus medius activation, measured using EMG signal inten-
sity, in runners with PFP.264 A prospective cohort study
reported a lower risk for development of PFP in runners with
journal of orthopaedic & sports physical therapy | volume 49 | number 9 | september 2019 | cpg15Patellofemoral Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesPatellofemoral Pain: Clinical Practice Guidelines
higher eccentric hip abductor strength.243 This study, how-
ever, was limited by a large number of participants who did
not complete the follow-up. Another prospective study found
that high school runners with the weakest hip abductor
strength had a higher incidence of PFP.185
II An earlier meta-analysis of 10 cross-sectional stud-
ies by Van Cant et al286 reported deficits in isometric
hip abduction, extension, external rotation, and
flexion in people with PFP compared to healthy participants.
Among studies that used the unaffected side for comparison,
2 studies reported deficits in hip abduction and 1 study re-
ported deficits in hip extension and hip external rotation for
the side with PFP.
III In a cross-sectional study, Nunes et al214 compared
the rate of force development and isometric
strength of the hip abductor and extensor muscle
groups in 54 (27 with PFP, 27 healthy) physically active wom-
en. The rate of force development was assessed for time to
reach 30%, 60%, and 90% of peak isometric torque. Women
with PFP had 10% weaker hip abductors (effect size, 0.61)
and 15% weaker hip extensors (effect size, 0.76) than knee-
healthy women. Their rate of force development for hip ab-
ductors was moderately slower than knee-healthy women for
the time to reach 60% (effect size, 0.50) and 90% (effect size,
0.59) of peak isometric torque. The rate of force development
for the hip extensors in women with PFP was markedly slow-
er in the time to reach 30% (effect size, 0.97) and 60% (effect
size, 0.81) of peak isometric torque.
III McMoreland et al191 examined hip isometric
strength and hip concentric muscle endurance in
young women with mild PFP (n = 12) compared to
age- and sex-matched controls (n = 12). They reported no
differences in peak torque (isometric strength) and total work
(endurance) for the hip abductors, external rotators, and in-
ternal rotators.
III A case-control study by Van Cant et al287 evaluated
muscle endurance of the hip abductors, trunk ex-
tensors, and ankle plantar flexors in women with
PFP (n = 20) compared to healthy controls (n = 76). Women
with PFP had 16% weaker hip abductors, 14% weaker trunk
extensors, and 26% weaker ankle plantar flexors compared
to knee-healthy women.
III Steinberg et al271 identified factors associated with
PFP in youth dancers. Dancers aged 10 to 11 years
with PFP were more likely to have less hip abduc-
tion range of motion (ROM) (OR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.99)
and less low back and hamstring flexibility (OR = 3.54; 95%
CI: 1.02, 12.28). In dancers aged 12 to 14 years, those with
PFP were more likely to have less ankle dorsiflexion ROM
(OR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.99), less hindfoot varum (OR =
0.26), and greater patellar mobility (OR = 2.67; 95% CI: 1.14,
6.35). In dancers aged 15 to 16 years, those with PFP were
more likely to have scoliosis (OR = 5.21; 95% CI: 1.35, 20.05)
and greater ankle plantar flexion and hip internal rotation
ROM (OR = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.1).
Distal Factors
II Lankhorst et al172 performed a systematic review of
7 case-control or cross-sectional studies of static foot
measures. Arch height index was not associated with
PFP. The numbers of people with PFP with pes cavus or pes
planus were not different from knee-healthy controls.
II The systematic review of 24 studies (3 prospective
cohorts, 17 case-controls, and 4 case series) by
Waryasz and McDermott298 reported no association
between foot alignment (pes cavus or pes planus) and PFP.
Gastrocnemius tightness was reported in patients with PFP
compared to controls in 2 of 3 studies.
II A systematic review of 24 case-control studies by
Barton et al20 reported that slower rate of time to
peak rearfoot eversion and a greater amount of
rearfoot eversion at initial heel contact during walking were
characteristic of patients with PFP. Patients with PFP exhib-
ited less rearfoot eversion motion during running.
II Neal et al207 performed a systematic review of 4
studies investigating foot posture as a risk factor for
the development of PFP. Navicular drop, measured
as a continuous variable, was a risk factor for developing PFP
(SMD, 0.33; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.65). When navicular drop was
characterized as a dichotomous variable, pooled data indi-
cated no relationship between pronated foot posture and an
increased risk of the development of PFP. However, measures
of foot mobility can discriminate between those with PFP and
knee-healthy controls.16,33,193
II A systematic review found limited evidence from 3
studies for plantar loading (ie, plantar pressure) as
a risk factor for PFP.92 Greater lateral COP dis-
placement and lower maximal displacement velocity of me-
diolateral COP during midstance of walking were
demonstrated in people who developed PFP. During running,
higher rates of time to peak force in the lateral heel and peak
force in the central metatarsal regions were demonstrated in
people who developed PFP.
III Tan et al276 reported that people aged 40 to 50 years
with PFP had less foot mobility than people aged 18
to 29 years and aged 30 to 39 years who also had PFP.

ety, fear avoidance, AKPS scores, Functional Index Question-
naire (FIQ) scores, quadriceps cross-sectional area, and
gastrocnemius muscle length. The authors also reported that
there is strong evidence that pain coping skills and kinesio-
phobia are not predictive of PFP or patellofemoral symptoms
and function. Baseline pain intensity is not predictive of pain
at follow-up, and baseline activity-related pain is not predic-
tive of function at follow-up. There is moderate evidence that
the triple jump test; muscle length of the quadriceps, ham-
strings, or soleus; and activities of daily living (ADLs) are not
predictive of pain or function. Bilateral symptoms and the
step test are not predictive of pain. There was limited evi-
dence that BMI, anxiety, being an athlete, and movement
quality were not predictive of pain or function. There was
also limited evidence that gastrocnemius muscle length, de-
pression, working status, and the single-leg jump test did not
predict pain. In addition, there is limited evidence that fear
avoidance at work, muscle recruitment, work type, and pre-
ferred treatment were not predictive of function.
I In a follow-up study of 2 RCTs at 5 to 8 years, 57%
of participants reported unfavorable outcomes, but
there was a minimal presence of knee OA.57,173 Simi-
lar to previous studies, those with a longer duration of symp-
toms and poorer function were more likely to have worse
outcomes at long-term follow-up.174
I An RCT was conducted to investigate the effects of
prefabricated foot orthoses, flat inserts, and physi-
cal therapy on individuals with PFP.57 Individuals
treated with physical therapy, prefabricated foot orthoses, or
a combination of both demonstrated improvement in at least
85% of cases at 6 weeks and at least 80% of cases at 52 weeks.
Longer duration of symptoms and poorer function, as mea-
sured by the AKPS, were most often associated with poor
outcomes.57
II A systematic review was performed by Matthews et
al189 to determine which factors could predict out-
comes in patients with PFP. Longer duration of
knee pain (greater than 4 months), older age, higher baseline
pain severity, and lower patient-reported function on the
AKPS were predictive of unsuccessful outcomes for pain and
function.
II Collins et al59 described the proportions of individu-
als with poor outcomes at 3 and 12 months after
randomization in 2 different clinical trials with a
total of 310 patients. More than half (55%) of individuals re-
ported an unfavorable outcome at 3 months, and 40% re-
ported an unfavorable outcome at 12 months. Individuals
with a duration of pain greater than 2 months from random-
ization, worse resting or activity-related pain, and poorer
Summary
Physically active women were more likely to develop PFP
compared to physically active men. Participation by women
in a single sport as opposed to participation by women in
multiple sports was associated with a higher incidence of
PFP. Isometric knee extensor weakness was predictive of the
development of PFP. Women with PFP may have lower knee
extensor, hip extensor, hip abductor, and hip external rotator
strength than women without PFP.
In studies of men and women, weakness in isometric muscle
strength of the hip and knee and decreased flexibility of the
quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius muscles may be
present in people with PFP.
Inconclusive and conflicting evidence exists on the relation-
ship between altered foot mechanics and the development
or presence of PFP.
Psychological Factors
II A systematic review by Maclachlan et al186 exam-
ined the association of psychological factors in pa-
tients with PFP. They reviewed 25 studies that
included 1357 participants with PFP (66% female) and 349
healthy controls (48% female), with subgroupings based on
4 psychological constructs: mental health, cognitive factors,
behavioral factors, and other psychological factors. They re-
ported that mental health (anxiety, depression), cognitive
factors (pain catastrophizing), and behavioral factors (fear of
movement) may be elevated in participants with PFP, and are
likely associated with higher pain and lower function. A sub-
sequent cross-sectional study by the same authors187 com-
pared psychological profiles between 100 participants with
PFP and 50 controls who were matched for age, sex, and ac-
tivity levels. This study also included a preplanned subgroup
analysis according to the severity of PFP (based on the Knee
injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS]). No dif-
ferences were seen between the PFP and pain-free groups for
anxiety, depression, catastrophizing, and kinesiophobia.
However, those with more severe PFP demonstrated higher
levels of depression and catastrophizing compared to the
controls, and higher levels of kinesiophobia, depression, and
catastrophizing compared to the less severe PFP subgroup.
Prognostic Factors
I Panken et al219 performed a systematic review to
determine which clinical factors were able to pre-
dict pain, function, or recovery in patients with
PFP. They reported limited evidence for several factors as
predictors of pain: frequency of pain, pain catastrophizing,
fear avoidance, AKPS scores, quadriceps cross-sectional area,
and muscle recruitment. There was limited evidence for the
following predictors of function: pain catastrophizing, anxi-

tion of AKP during squatting is the diagnostic test reported
to have the best sensitivity (in the absence of pain) and di-
agnostic accuracy.64,215,222 The patellar tilt test is a nonpro-
vocative test for PFP, with reduced mobility (positive test)
prompting a moderate change in the likelihood of PFP be-
ing present.215
Gaps in Knowledge
Additional research is needed to determine the best reference
standard to be utilized for studies of diagnostic test accuracy
using individual or a combination of tests.64,215
Recommendations
A Clinicians should use reproduction of retropatellar
or peripatellar pain during squatting as a diagnostic
test for PFP.64,215,222 Clinicians should also use per-
formance of other functional activities that load the PFJ in a
flexed position, such as stair climbing or descent, as diagnos-
tic tests for PFP.64,215,222
B Clinicians should make the diagnosis of PFP using
the following criteria:
1. The presence of retropatellar or peripatellar pain64,215,222
AND
2. Reproduction of retropatellar or peripatellar pain with
squatting, stair climbing, prolonged sitting, or other func-
tional activities loading the PFJ in a flexed position64,215,222
AND
3. Exclusion of all other conditions that may cause AKP, in-
cluding tibiofemoral pathologies64,215,222
C Clinicians may use the patellar tilt test with the
presence of hypomobility to support the diagnosis
of PFP.215
CLASSIFICATION
Multiple biomechanical and neuromusculoskeletal factors
related to the knee, hip, ankle, and trunk/pelvis have been
reported to be associated with PFP.19,20,172,206,241,286 Similar to
low back pain, clinicians recognize that PFP is not a homo-
geneous condition, and response to intervention varies.18,311
As a result, several classification systems with subcategories
of PFP have been proposed for nonsurgical management of
patients. Many of these classification systems are based on
proposed pathoanatomical diagnoses, which rely on diagnos-
tic imaging or surgical findings.108,144,148,195,256,306,315 These clas-
sification systems are of limited utility for physical therapists
because they do not include clear diagnostic criteria for each
subcategory, or they rely on imaging or surgical findings that
may not always be available to the physical therapist at the
initial encounter.
function, as measured by the AKPS, were more likely to have
an unfavorable recovery.59
Summary
Individuals with a longer duration of symptoms, higher base-
line pain severity, and poorer function were more likely to
have negative outcomes or unfavorable recovery.
DIAGNOSIS
I Systematic reviews of diagnostic tests for PFP
demonstrate that the majority of clinical tests have
poor diagnostic accuracy.64,215 Clusters of diagnos-
tic tests were found to be no more accurate than individual
tests.215 A high-quality systematic review reported that the
most accurate diagnostic tests were reproduction of retro-
patellar pain during squatting (positive likelihood ratio
[+LR] = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.3; negative likelihood ratio [–
LR] = 0.2; 95% CI: 0.1, 0.4) and hypomobility with the pa-
tellar tilt test (+LR = 5.4; 95% CI: 1.4, 20.8; –LR = 0.6; 95%
CI: 0.5, 0.8).215
I A systematic review of reviews concluded that func-
tional tasks that cause AKP, such as squatting, stair
climbing, and sitting with flexed knees, are cur-
rently the best diagnostic tests for PFP.222 Accordingly, in the
recent study by Collins et al,61 a large majority of individuals
with PFP reported at least some difficulty with squatting
(93.7%), stair negotiation (91.2%), and running (90.8%).
II A systematic review on the accuracy of diagnostic
tests for PFP reported that diagnosis is challenging
in part due to the lack of a clear gold standard as a
reference test.64 Studies of diagnostic test accuracy rely on a
physician’s diagnosis, the presence of AKP believed to be re-
lated to the PFJ, and/or provocation of retropatellar/peri-
patellar pain with activity as reference standards.64
II A systematic review examining diagnostic test ac-
curacy for PFP reported that this condition should
be considered a diagnosis of exclusion; other condi-
tions that may cause AKP must be ruled out prior to ruling
in PFP.64,71,311
Evidence Synthesis and Clinical Rationale
Diagnosis of PFP is challenging due to differing reference
standards used to determine diagnostic test accuracy.64 Re-
gardless of reference standard, diagnostic tests for PFP have
poor accuracy.64,215,222 Clusters of diagnostic tests that have
been examined to date have not improved diagnostic accu-
racy.215 The best diagnostic tests at this time are those that
provoke AKP during functional activities when the PFJ is
loaded in a flexed-knee position.222 Accordingly, reproduc-

PFP Impairment/Function-Based Classification Subcategories
1. Support for the “overuse/overload without other impair-
ment” subcategory is based on the following evidence.
III One potential factor leading to PFP is performing
activities that load the patellofemoral compartment
with too much load magnitude,96 too much load fre-
quency,96 and/or at too great a rate of increase, that is, over-
use.55,277,278 When individuals increase the magnitude and/or
frequency of PFJ loading during an activity at a rate greater
than musculoskeletal tissues can adapt, they move into a zone
of supraphysiologic overload and eventual pain.96,235 Evidence
of excessive physiologic loading has been reported for runners
with PFP who exhibited increased patellar bone water content,
suggestive of patellar swelling, compared to pain-free con-
trols.138 Draper et al93 also reported elevated PFJ bone meta-
bolic activity in individuals with chronic PFP, which may be a
response to bone stress. They found a moderate positive cor-
relation between tracer uptake in PFJ bone and pain intensity
(R2 = 0.55, P = .0005), suggesting an association between bone
remodeling and PFP.93 Individuals at risk of developing PFP
due to overuse may include athletes55,128,277,278 and the military
population when undergoing basic training.155,277
Load Magnitude
Load magnitude refers to the amount of PFJ loading result-
ing from physical activity. Briani et al37 compared reported
knee pain in women with and without PFP who participat-
ed in moderate or intense physical activity. Women in the
intense physical activity PFP group reported significantly
higher self-reported knee pain during the previous month
and before a PFJ loading protocol used in this study.37 A re-
gression analysis revealed that 32% of reported pain intensity
was predicted by intense physical activity levels. Moderate
physical activity level was not a significant predictor of pain.
One population that experiences rapid increases in the over-
all magnitude of PFJ loading is military recruits during basic
training. Thijs et al281 conducted a prospective study of male
and female officer cadets entering a military academy and ini-
tiated a 6-week intensive physical training program. Eighty-
four of the 105 cadets had no history of previous knee injury or
pain (65 males). Thirty-six of these 84 (43%) cadets (25 males)
developed PFP during training. The authors concluded that
PFP in this population resulted from repetitive loads placed
on the PFJ tissues with minimal recovery time.281
Overuse as a cause of PFP may be related to greater running
magnitude and runner experience (eg, recreational runners
and higher-caliber runners). A retrospective analysis of 2002
patients with running injuries showed that the most com-
mon running-related injury for both sexes was PFP.277 Mul-
tivariate analysis revealed that being either a higher-caliber
III Selfe et al261 conducted a cross-sectional observa-
tional study examining a classification system con-
sisting of 6 proposed subcategories for PFP, the
targeted interventions for patellofemoral pain syndrome
(TIPPS). These 6 subcategories were based on expert consen-
sus and clinically feasible assessment tests.258 Because the
subcategories were found to not be mutually exclusive,261 the
original 6 subcategories were revised and collapsed into 3
subcategories: weak and tight, weak and pronated foot, and
strong.261 The TIPPS classification system has yet to be ap-
plied to patients to determine its efficacy in guiding treat-
ment and improving outcomes.
IV A PFP classification system that utilizes clinical
tests was proposed by Selhorst et al262 in a case-se-
ries pilot feasibility study for targeted interven-
tions. The authors used results from the Fear-Avoidance
Beliefs Questionnaire and clinical tests of impairment and
neuromuscular deficits to classify patients. This classification
pilot study was conducted in adolescents with a mean ± SD
age of 14.10 ± 1.38 years,262 potentially resulting in minimal
applicability to adults with PFP.
Evidence Synthesis and Clinical Rationale
Patellofemoral pain is a heterogeneous condition; persons
with PFP do not all have the same impairments, and not all
persons with PFP respond to the same interventions.18,311 At
this time, there is no valid and reliable classification system
for PFP that does not require imaging or surgical findings.
A classification system based on symptoms and physical
examination findings would be useful to guide the physical
therapist’s plan of care.258,261,262 Such a classification system
would be useful to select interventions for persons with PFP.
It would also be useful for researchers to examine factors
associated with subcategories of PFP and to determine the
optimal interventions for each subcategory.
Gaps in Knowledge
No PFP classification system exists that is based on symp-
toms and physical examination findings and has been shown
to be valid and reliable.
Recommendation
F Given the absence of a previously established valid
classification system for PFP, the CPG group pro-
poses a classification consisting of 4 subcategories
associated with the ICF. This proposed classification system
is based on published evidence; the subcategories are named
according to predominant impairments previously docu-
mented in persons with PFP. Clinicians may consider using
the proposed impairment/function-based PFP classification
system to guide patient/client management.

of PFJ loading at a rate that surpasses the ability of the PFJ
tissues to recover.
2. Support for the “muscle performance deficits” subcategory
is based on the following evidence.
Hip Strength Deficits
III Females with PFP have hip weakness, particularly
with isometric strength testing.241,245,286 Originally
thought to be a risk factor for PFP onset, hip weak-
ness, especially of the hip abductors, extensors, and external
rotators, has been shown to result from PFP.133,245
Hip/Thigh Strength Responders
The reason for the resulting hip weakness remains unclear;
however, evidence supports the importance of resistance ex-
ercises targeting the hip muscles as part of the intervention
for individuals with PFP.168,228 While an important treatment
strategy, not all individuals with PFP may respond favorably.
Ferber et al105 compared outcomes for 199 individuals with
PFP who completed either a 6-week hip/core- or knee-based
exercise program. They found that 67% of participants re-
sponded favorably to treatment, regardless of group assign-
ment. In a secondary analysis, the authors determined that
only males and females who exhibited an increase in hip and
thigh strength following treatment responded positively to
the resistance exercise intervention.31 Beginning strength
values, expressed as a percentage of body mass, for males
who responded favorably were, on average, 37%, 13%, 28%,
and 44% of body mass for the hip abductors, hip external
rotators, hip extensors, and quadriceps, respectively. Values
for female responders were, on average, 30%, 17%, 30%, and
37% of body mass for the hip abductors, hip external rotators,
hip extensors, and quadriceps, respectively.
Gap in Knowledge
While we have provided average values to identify weakness,
additional investigations are needed to further quantify
strength values using identical methods.
Summary
A subcategory of individuals with PFP may respond favorably
to hip and knee resistance exercises. Classification into the
muscle performance deficits subcategory is made with a fair
level of certainty when the patient presents with lower extrem-
ity muscle performance deficits in the hip and quadriceps.
3. Support for the “movement coordination deficits” subcat-
egory is based on the following evidence.
III Powers237 has theorized that increased hip adduc-
tion, hip internal rotation, and knee abduction (ie,
knee valgus) during dynamic activities can increase
runner, defined as competing at provincial/state, national, or
international levels (ie, highly competitive running level), or
a recreational runner who ran less than 5 hours per week was
a protective factor for PFP onset in females.277 This finding
suggested that the PFJ structures in the most experienced
runners most likely had adapted to, and thus were capable
of tolerating, the imposed loads. Alternatively, runners with
much less experience most likely did not apply the magnitude
of loading necessary to adversely affect the PFJ.
An injury prevention program had no effect on PFP or oth-
er lower extremity overuse injuries in military recruits.38
Brushøj et al38 developed a prevention program to address
common impairments (eg, gluteal and quadriceps muscle
weakness, quadriceps tightness, and increased knee valgus
during squatting and lunging tasks) for military recruits
prior to beginning a 3-month basic training program. At the
end of the basic training program, no differences existed in
overuse injury rates between those who participated in the
prevention program and controls.38 This finding suggests that
increased magnitude of PFJ loading during physical activity,
with insufficient tissue recovery time, may be the strongest
etiologic factor for PFP in the military population.
Load Frequency
Load frequency refers to the amount of repetition of an activi-
ty. Recreational runners who increase not only the magnitude
of loading but also the frequency of loading, with inadequate
tissue recovery time, represent a cohort at high risk for de-
veloping PFP. Thijs et al279 examined the foot posture (higher
or lower arch) and motion (pronation and supination) of 102
(89 females) novice recreational runners enrolled in a 10-
week start-to-run program. They prospectively followed the
runners and reported that 17 participants developed PFP.
Analyses showed that neither foot posture nor motion pre-
dicted PFP onset.279 In a subsequent prospective study, Thijs
et al280 followed 77 novice female recreational runners (with
no history of prior knee injury or pain) enrolled in a 10-week
start-to-run program to determine the effect of peak isomet-
ric hip muscle force on PFP onset. Sixteen runners developed
PFP; however, logistic regression did not identify isometric
hip force as a predictive factor for onset of PFP.280 Together,
results from these studies showed that impairments com-
monly associated with PFP were not predictive of PFP on-
set. These findings suggested that beginning a new repetitive
activity involving PFJ loading could have caused PFP onset.
Summary
A subcategory of individuals with PFP may have pain primar-
ily due to overuse/overload. Classification into the overuse/
overload without other impairment subcategory is made with
a fair level of certainty when the patient presents with a his-
tory suggesting an increase in magnitude and/or frequency
cpg20 | september 2019 | volume 49 | number 9 | journal of orthopaedic & sports physical therapyPatellofemoral Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesPatellofemoral Pain: Clinical Practice Guidelines
The diagnosis of PFP with movement coordination deficits
is made with a fair level of certainty when the patient pre-
sents with excessive or poorly controlled knee valgus during
a dynamic task, not necessarily due to weakness of the lower
extremity musculature.
4. Support for the “mobility impairments” subcategory is
based on the following evidence.
Hypermobility-Related Influences
III Although patellar instability is outside the scope
of this CPG, increased foot mobility deserves at-
tention. Selfe et al261 classified individuals with
PFP and a greater than 6-point Foot Posture Index (FPI)
score as having a pronated foot. Mills et al196 found benefi-
cial effects with orthosis use for individuals with PFP and a
greater than 11-mm difference between non–weight-bearing
and weight-bearing midfoot width. Moreover, the use of
foot orthoses has been recommended as an adjunctive treat-
ment for PFP.18
Hypomobility-Related Influences
Lack of flexibility of structures around the knee has been
more extensively examined due to their direct or indirect
potential for increasing the compressive forces at the PFJ.
Commonly assessed structures have included the ham-
strings, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, soleus, lateral reti-
naculum (using the patellar tilt test), and iliotibial band.
Piva at al232 found several significant differences when
comparing flexibility between those with and without PFP.
In individuals with PFP, hamstring (measured by passive
hip flexion during a straight leg raise performed in supine),
gastrocnemius (measured by ankle dorsiflexion performed
in prone with the knee extended), and soleus (measured
by ankle dorsiflexion performed in prone with the knee
flexed) lengths, when measured by goniometry, were less
than 79.1°, 7.4°, and 14.8°, respectively. The authors also
reported values of less than 11° for iliotibial band (measured
in the Ober position with the knee flexed to 90°) and 134.0°
for quadriceps (measured with prone knee flexion) lengths
when measured using an inclinometer. A positive patellar
tilt test assessed via palpation can suggest lateral retinacu-
lum tightness in the PFP population.215
Gaps in Knowledge
Hip internal and external rotation ROM has received some
attention. Specifically, limited hip external rotation ROM
could place the femur in a more internally rotated position,
leading to an increased dynamic Q angle and lateral PFJ
loading.130,236 Further work is needed to identify threshold
values for hip ROM potentially contributing to PFP. Future
studies also are needed to better understand responses to
treatment specifically directed toward these structures.
the dynamic Q angle. Knee abduction and external rotation
also increase the Q angle by moving the tibial tubercle lateral
relative to the patella. Together, these altered movements can
impart increased stress to the lateral PFJ.177,253
Clinicians commonly observe hip and knee movement dur-
ing an SLS to identify individuals with PFP and movement
coordination deficits. Findings from independent investiga-
tions support that females with PFP perform the SLS with an
increased FPPA134 and greater medial knee displacement125,307
than controls. Medial knee displacement during the SLS also
has been associated with increased hip adduction and knee
external rotation during running and jumping tasks.307 It is
noteworthy that these investigators did not assess hip or knee
strength,134,307 precluding the ability to discern the effect, if
any, of hip and knee strength on the FPPA.
Almeida et al5 compared hip strength and the FPPA during
the SLS in individuals with and without PFP. Those with PFP
demonstrated less hip strength and higher FPPA than con-
trols. However, a significant correlation between hip strength
and FPPA only existed for controls, and these correlations,
while significant, were not strong for controls (hip abduc-
tor torque and peak FPPA: P<.05, R2 = 0.096). This finding
suggested that factors other than strength likely affected SLS
performance in those with PFP.242
Decreased neuromuscular control may contribute to an in-
creased FPPA during dynamic tasks. While we cannot con-
clusively make this determination, emerging data support
the importance of movement retraining. Graci and Salsich120
examined trunk, hip, and knee kinematics during the SLS
in females with PFP under 2 conditions (with and without
instruction for maintaining good pelvic and hip position) in
a single session. With instruction, participants performed
the SLS with a significant increase in contralateral pelvic
elevation and decreases in hip adduction and internal rota-
tion. Moreover, a significant association existed between de-
creased pain and less hip internal rotation (r = 0.46).
Gaps in Knowledge
Additional studies are needed to identify the best methods
and threshold values for identifying movement coordination
deficits.131 Future works also are needed to better understand
the effect that movement retraining may specifically have on
these measures.
Summary
A subcategory of individuals with PFP may respond fa-
vorably to gait retraining and movement re-education
interventions, leading to improvements in lower extrem-
ity kinematics and pain and suggesting the importance of
assessing dynamic knee valgus during movement.35,100,206,252

Clinicians should use review-of-systems screening tools to
screen for medical and other conditions requiring referral
of a patient to another health care provider.111 The Optimal
Screening for Prediction of Referral and Outcome-review of
systems (OSPRO-ROS) tool was developed in a cohort study of
431 patients with primary complaints of back, neck, knee, and
shoulder conditions treated in 11 outpatient physical therapy
clinics.111 Review-of-systems screening tools provide the clini-
cian with a systematic method to screen for red flags that may
indicate more sinister causes of musculoskeletal pain.111 The
score on a 10-item OSPRO-ROS improved prediction of men-
tal health quality of life at 12 months in a follow-up validation
study.112 Adding 13 items to the OSPRO-ROS improved pre-
diction of change in comorbidity status at 12 months.112
To screen for the presence of acute fracture as a cause of
knee pain, clinicians should use either the Ottawa97,163 or
Pittsburgh163,257 knee decision rules. Both of these decision
rules have high sensitivity for acute knee fracture, and their
use has been shown to avoid unnecessary radiography.163 The
Ottawa knee rule is reported to be more sensitive than the
Pittsburgh knee rule, but it is limited to persons aged 18 years
and older.163 The Pittsburgh knee rule may be used with per-
sons of all ages.163
Hip and thigh pathology has been reported to refer pain to
the knee.179 Persons who participate in high levels of physical
activity (eg, military personnel undergoing physical training)
may develop femoral fractures that masquerade as PFP.45,304
Children and adolescents with knee pain may have referred
pain from a slipped capital femoral epiphysis or other hip
pathology.1,316,317 In children with knee pain, a limp is a sign
of possible hip pathology.1,316
Musculoskeletal Differential Diagnosis
Following exclusion of medical conditions that require re-
ferral of the patient to a physician, the clinician must rule
out other musculoskeletal conditions that may cause AKP.
These conditions are appropriate for physical therapy but
may require a plan of care that is different from that for the
treatment of PFP. The differential diagnosis should consider
conditions that are distant but may refer pain to the knee,
for example, lumbar radiculopathy, peripheral nerve entrap-
ment, or hip OA.24,40
The lumbar spine may refer pain to the anterior thigh and
knee.24,40 Clinicians should perform a lower-quarter screen as
part of the examination of a patient with suspected PFP, in-
cluding examination of the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joint
regions. Clinicians should refer to the low back pain CPG
published by the Academy of Orthopaedic Physical Therapy,
APTA, Inc for guidance on screening for the presence of re-
ferred pain from the low back.83
Summary
A subcategory of individuals with PFP may have impair-
ments related to either hypermobile or hypomobile struc-
tures. The diagnosis of PFP with mobility impairments is
made with a fair level of certainty when the patient presents
with higher than normal foot mobility and/or flexibility def-
icits of 1 or more of the following structures: hamstrings,
quadriceps, gastrocnemius, soleus, lateral retinaculum, or
iliotibial band.
Classification Summary
Clinicians should consider serious pathological conditions
other than/separate from PFP when the patient’s reported
activity limitations or impairments of body function and
structure are not consistent with those presented in the
Diagnosis and Classification sections of this guideline, or
when the patient’s symptoms are not resolving with inter-
ventions aimed at normalization of the patient’s impair-
ments of body function. Clinicians should consider whether
the patient corresponds to 1 or more of the following cat-
egories: (1) overuse/overload without other impairment,
(2) muscle performance deficits, (3) movement coordina-
tion deficits, and/or (4) mobility impairments. In addition,
clinicians should identify the level of tissue irritability and
should screen for the presence of psychological factors that
may impact the patient’s response to physical therapy and/
or require referral to another health care practitioner.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Clinicians should consider diagnostic classifications associ-
ated with serious medical conditions, other musculoskeletal
conditions, or psychosocial factors when the patient’s re-
ported activity limitations or impairments of body function
and structure are not consistent with those presented in
the Diagnosis and Classification sections of this guideline,
or when the patient’s symptoms are not resolving with in-
terventions aimed at normalization of the patient’s impair-
ments of body function.
Medical Differential Diagnosis
The following medical conditions, although not intended to
be a comprehensive list, should be in the clinician’s differen-
tial diagnosis for knee pain and require referral to another
health care practitioner43:
• Tumors
• Dislocation
• Septic arthritis
• Arthrofibrosis
• Deep vein thrombosis
• Neurovascular compromise
• Fracture (local and/or at the hip)
• Slipped capital femoral epiphysis in children or adolescents
cpg22 | september 2019 | volume 49 | number 9 | journal of orthopaedic & sports physical therapyPatellofemoral Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesPatellofemoral Pain: Clinical Practice Guidelines
movement (a positive apprehension test) may provide confir-
mation.162 Clinicians should refer to the consensus statement
written by the international patellofemoral osteoarthritis
consortium for clinical symptoms and signs to screen for the
presence of PFOA.293
Anterior knee pain in children may be due to apophysitis of
the tibial tubercle (Osgood-Schlatter disease) or the inferior
pole of the patella (Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease).317,318
Clinicians should use the patient’s age and the presence
of tenderness to palpation over the tibial tubercle or infe-
rior pole of the patella to determine the presence of these
conditions.316
Patellofemoral pain may be experienced following surgical
procedures, for example, anterior cruciate ligament recon-
struction (ACLR).76,77 Although PFP is common in persons
following ACLR, this may present differently from nonsur-
gical PFP due to alterations in the normal knee biomechan-
ics.77 This guideline does not apply to PFP following surgery
to the knee or other musculoskeletal regions of the lower
extremity.
Screening for Psychological Factors
Clinicians should screen for the presence of psychological
issues that may require referral to a health care practitio-
ner in addition to physical therapy, for example, a clini-
cal psychologist.186,187 Psychological factors including pain
catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, fear avoidance, anxiety, and
depression are considered yellow flags that may affect prog-
nosis and rehabilitation treatment decision making.178 In
addition to potential referral, patients with PFP who exhibit
psychological factors may require the therapist to employ
specific patient education strategies to optimize outcomes
from physical therapy interventions, for example, cognitive-
behavioral treatment, reassurance, and graded exposure to
activity.25
Persons with PFP may be under psychological stress and may
also have chronic pain and central sensitization. Psychologi-
cal stress negatively influences recovery. Fear of reinjury/
pain/movement is a frequently cited reason that athletes do
not return to sport or reduce their level of physical activity
in other knee disorders.9,10 A systematic review reported that
catastrophization and fear avoidance had strong and con-
sistent associations with pain and function in persons with
PFP.186 Chronic pain can be accompanied by central sensitiza-
tion, which encompasses factors like hyperalgesia (reduced
pressure pain threshold) to regions both at and remote to the
“involved” structure. Noehren et al213 found that females with
PFP reported lower pressure pain thresholds (determined via
pressure algometry) in multiple sites at the knee as well as
the elbow.
Hip OA has been reported to present with a primary com-
plaint of knee pain.171,233 Clinicians should refer to the hip
pain and mobility deficits—hip OA CPG published by the
Academy of Orthopaedic Physical Therapy, APTA, Inc for
guidance on the examination procedures and symptoms to
determine the presence of hip OA.51,52
The differential diagnosis should also consider conditions lo-
cal to the knee, for example, ligamentous (cruciate and collat-
eral) injuries, meniscus injuries, articular cartilage injuries,
OA, distal iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS), quadriceps and
patellar tendinopathies, plica syndrome, patellar (Sinding-
Larsen-Johansson lesion) and tibial (Osgood-Schlatter le-
sion) apophysitis, and patellar subluxation or dislocation
(instability).
Structures that are part of the tibiofemoral articulation, such
as ligament, meniscus, and articular cartilage injuries, may
be a source of AKP.227 Clinicians should refer to the CPGs
published by the Academy of Orthopaedic Physical Therapy,
APTA, Inc for guidance on the examination procedures for
determining the presence of ligamentous, meniscal, and ar-
ticular cartilage conditions/injuries.181-184 Persons with ITBS
are typically runners, complain of onset of lateral knee pain
following running for 1.2 km or longer, and have pain pro-
voked by palpation of the lateral femoral epicondyle with the
knee at 30° of flexion (Noble compression test).13
The patellofemoral articulation may have musculoskeletal
conditions other than PFP that cause knee pain.161 The fol-
lowing differential diagnosis has been suggested for knee
pain based on anatomical site43:
• Anterior knee pain
- PFP
- Patellar tendinopathy ( jumper’s knee)
- Patellar subluxation or dislocation (instability)
- Tibial apophysitis (Osgood-Schlatter lesion)
- Patellar apophysitis (Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease)
Clinicians should use information from the patient’s age,
history, provocative activities, and physical examination test
results to screen for the presence of other possible causes of
AKP.43,293 Pain from patellar tendinopathy is typically local-
ized to the inferior pole of the patella or near the tibial tu-
bercle.188 Patellar tendinopathy may be differentiated from
PFP by pain located over the patellar tendon, tenderness to
palpation of the patellar tendon, and symptom response. Pain
from patellar tendinopathy is aggravated by activities that
require higher rates of knee extensor loading, such as jump-
ing (eg, basketball, volleyball) or high-speed sprinting (eg,
football/soccer).188 If patellar instability or a history of patel-
lar dislocation is suspected from subjective interview, then
reported apprehension with passively applied lateral patellar

is a concise, multidimensional yellow flag assessment tool,
developed from a study of 431 patients with musculoskeletal
conditions examined with 136 items from 11 validated ques-
tionnaires of psychological constructs.178 The score on the
OSPRO-YF was found to improve prediction of persistent
musculoskeletal pain intensity, disability, and quality of life
at 12 months.112
Screening tools for psychological factors and other yellow
flags can be used by the clinician during the examination.
These tools include the Pain Catastrophizing Scale,272 the
Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire,297 and the OSPRO
yellow flag assessment tool (OSPRO-YF).178 The Fear-Avoid-
ance Beliefs Questionnaire items have been modified to re-
fer to the knee rather than to the back.118 The OSPRO-YF

OUTCOME MEASURES
Activity Limitations/Self-report Measures
A vast number of patient-reported outcome measures
(PROMs) have been developed and used to assess a patient’s
perceived function and change in status over time for persons
with PFP. These PROMs have varying levels of evidence to
support their use for individuals with impairments of body
function and structure, activity limitations, and participation
restrictions associated with PFP.
Systematic Reviews
I Papadopoulos et al222 performed a high-quality sys-
tematic review of reviews for several factors related
to PFP, including outcome measurements. The au-
thors identified 2 systematic reviews of outcome measures,
by Howe et al146 and Esculier et al,101 which they evaluated
using the A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews
(AMSTAR) scoring tool. Results of these 2 reviews are pre-
sented individually below.
I Esculier et al101 performed a high-quality systematic
review of 24 articles on the psychometric properties
of 5 PROMs. Only PROMs that had at least 5 stud-
ies evaluating their psychometric properties were included:
the Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale
(KOS-ADLS), AKPS (originally known as the Kujala scale),
International Knee Documentation Committee 2000 Subjec-
tive Knee Evaluation Form (IKDC), Lysholm scale, and FIQ.
Several aspects of validity were assessed: content validity,
construct validity, discriminant (known-groups) validity,
structural (factorial) validity, and floor/ceiling effects. The
KOS-ADLS and Lysholm scale were found to have satisfac-
tory content validity. The FIQ and AKPS were easy to com-
plete and were poor and good, respectively, at depicting
symptoms. Construct validity for several PFP PROMs was
examined by determining correlations between scales: KOS-
ADLS to Lysholm scale, IKDC to Lysholm scale, and AKPS
to FIQ. These PROMs demonstrated moderate to high cor-
relations (r>0.5) in samples including patients with PFP. The
KOS-ADLS, AKPS, and Lysholm scale could discriminate
between different patient populations of knee conditions and
disability levels. All measures demonstrated adequate floor/
ceiling effects (less than 15% of participants achieved the low-
est or highest scores). The KOS-ADLS, IKDC, AKPS, and
Lysholm scale demonstrated high test-retest reliability, with
intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) ranging from 0.81 to
0.99 and weighted average ICCs from 0.92 to 0.96. The ICCs
for the FIQ ranged from 0.48 to 0.96 (weighted average ICC
= 0.61). The minimal detectable change at the 95% confi-
dence level (MDC95) was 8.3 for the KOS-ADLS, 8.5 for the
IKDC, 9.0 for the AKPS, 3.1 for the FIQ, and 30 for the
Lysholm scale. All questionnaires, except the Lysholm scale,
demonstrated good internal consistency, with Cronbach al-
pha values greater than .81 (Lysholm scale: α = .66). All ques-
tionnaires were found to be moderately to highly responsive
(moderate to high effect size or standardized response mean)
in patients with PFP.
II A systematic review by Green et al121 reported on 7
articles that evaluated the measurement properties
of 12 PROMs. Several instruments had moderate
levels of evidence for structural validity, a component of con-
struct validity: the Flandry Questionnaire (r = 0.65-0.66 with
the FIQ and the Eng and Pierrynowski Questionnaire [EPQ]),
the FIQ (r = –0.66 with the Flandry Questionnaire and EPQ),
the EPQ (r = 0.66 with the Flandry Questionnaire), the AKPS
(r = 0.58 with the FIQ), and the VAS for “usual” pain and the
VAS for “worst” pain were moderately correlated with each
other (r = 0.63). Limited evidence supported test-retest reli-
ability and cross-cultural and hypothesis testing components
of validity for the Persian version of the AKPS.
III Howe et al146 performed a low-quality systematic
review examining the clinimetric properties of
PROMs used with patients treated for various mus-
culoskeletal knee conditions, including ligamentous injuries,
meniscal lesions, OA, and PFP. The outcome measures ap-
praised by Howe et al146 also included clinician-administered
instruments. In addition to the low quality of the systematic
review, the authors did not critically appraise the articles in-
cluded in their review. Using expert consensus, Howe et al146
concluded that the AKPS demonstrated sufficient content
validity, test-retest reliability, and responsiveness to change
for persons with PFP according to the Outcome Measures in
Rheumatology (OMERACT) filter. They also reported that
the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) demonstrated
sufficient construct validity and test-retest reliability for PFP
according to the OMERACT filter.
Anterior Knee Pain Scale
The AKPS, originally known as the Kujala scale, is a 13-item
questionnaire for knee function in persons of all ages with
AKP, scored out of 100, with higher scores indicating less
disability.

I The psychometric properties of the English version
of the AKPS have been examined in 2 level I stud-
ies.70,302 Crossley et al70 evaluated the concurrent
validity of the AKPS by correlating change in the AKPS with
the global rating of change (GROC). Participants with GROC
ratings of +3 or higher (scale of –7 to +7, with –7 as the worst
status and +7 as the best status) were considered to have im-
proved. Concurrent validity using Spearman’s rho was 0.69.
Test-retest reliability was evaluated in 2 studies70,302 and was
found to be excellent (ICC = 0.817 and 0.953, respectively).
Responsiveness was reported in several studies. Crossley et
al70 reported that the AKPS median change score could dis-
criminate between those who improved and those who were
worse or stayed the same. Watson et al302 reported that the
AKPS change score had a fair association (r = 0.42) with the
criterion score (average of the therapist’s and patient’s GROC
score). The AKPS demonstrated fair discriminatory ability
between those with clinically meaningful reduction of patel-
lofemoral symptoms and those who did not have a reduction
(area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC]
curve [AUC] = 0.69). Crossley et al70 reported that the treat-
ment effect size of the AKPS was 1.15. The MDC for the AKPS
was 13 points.302 The minimal clinically important difference
(MCID) for the AKPS is 8 to 10 points.70
I Myer et al202 developed a 6-item short form of the
AKPS in 499 girl and adolescent female athletes.
The internal consistency of the 13-item form had a
Cronbach alpha of .92 and a standard error of measurement
(SEM) across all items of 0.003. Rasch difficulty (endors-
ability) estimates of the 6-item short form ranged from –3.57
to 1.27. The internal consistency of the 6-item form had a
Cronbach alpha of .88 and an SEM across all items of 0.004.
Criterion validity of the 6-item form against the 13-item form
was r = 0.96, with a point-biserial calculation of each form
against the PFP diagnosis of r = 0.72. The AKPS demon-
strated excellent predictive ability between the 13-item long
form and 6-item short form against the PFP diagnosis (AUC
= 0.95 for the long form and AUC = 0.93 for the short form).
A score of 4 on the short form and a score of 10 on the long
form could correctly confirm a physician’s diagnosis of PFP
with a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 91%.
II Ittenbach et al149 evaluated the reliability and valid-
ity of the AKPS in 414 girl, adolescent female, and
woman athletes (11.0-18.1 years of age). Criterion
validity of the AKPS was evaluated against the physician’s
diagnosis of knee pain. The median classification rates were
high in both healthy athletes (86%) and in athletes with PFP
(99%). The AKPS demonstrated good internal consistency
for both the 13-item long form (Cronbach α = .91) and 6-item
short form (Cronbach α = .84). The equivalence of the short
form with the long form was high (r = 0.98). The SEM for the
long form was 3.0 points and for the short form was 1.2
points.
AKPS Cross-cultural Translations
The AKPS has been translated and cross-culturally adapted
into 10 languages, with psychometric evidence to support the
use of the translations. These include Brazilian Portuguese,78
French,39 Persian,209 Turkish,167 Spanish,117 Greek,220 Arabic,6
Dutch,284 Chinese,49 and Thai.8 The MDC of the Dutch AKPS
is reported to be 11 points.284
KOS-ADLS and Knee Outcome Survey-Sports Activity Scale
The KOS-ADLS is a 14-item questionnaire for knee symp-
toms and function during ADLs due to a variety of knee
disorders, including PFP. It is scored out of 70 points, then
converted to 100 points to yield percentages, with higher
scores indicating less disability. The Knee Outcome Survey-
Sports Activity Scale (KOS-SAS) is an 11-item questionnaire
for knee symptoms and function during sports activities due
to a variety of knee disorders. It has a total score of 55 points,
converted to 100 points to yield percentages, with higher
scores indicating less disability.
I Piva et al231 assessed the responsiveness of the KOS-
ADLS in 60 individuals with PFP before and after
an intervention program by comparing KOS-ADLS
scores to GROC scores. The KOS-ADLS had a moderate stan-
dardized effect size (0.63) and demonstrated excellent dis-
crimination between those whose GROC scores worsened
and those whose scores did not (AUC = 0.83). The MCID for
the KOS-ADLS was estimated from a ROC curve and was
found to be a 5-point change in raw score or 7.1 percentage
points on the KOS-ADLS.
III Bradbury et al36 reported on the association be-
tween KOS-ADLS and KOS-SAS scores with the
Global Rating Scale (GRS) of perceived knee func-
tion. In a group of 15 patients with PFP, the GRS was strongly
associated with the KOS-ADLS (r = 0.85) and with the KOS-
SAS (r = 0.88).
IV Siqueira et al265 evaluated the KOS-ADLS and
IKDC in 31 patients with PFP. The KOS-ADLS and
IKDC were moderately correlated with each other
(r = 0.46). Test-retest reliability of the KOS-ADLS was excel-
lent (Spearman ρ = 0.99). The KOS-ADLS was deemed more
reliable than the IKDC.
KOS-ADLS Cross-cultural Translations
The KOS-ADLS has been translated and cross-culturally
adapted into Turkish, with psychometric evidence to sup-
port its use.103 The MDC of the Turkish KOS-ADLS was 2.59
points out of a total score of 70 points.
cpg26 | september 2019 | volume 49 | number 9 | journal of orthopaedic & sports physical therapyPatellofemoral Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesPatellofemoral Pain: Clinical Practice Guidelines
and Hughston Clinic subjective knee questionnaire, respec-
tively).175 Test-retest reliability of the PSS was excellent when
assessed in a sample of 24 of the original 29 participants
(Spearman ρ = 0.95).175
PSS Cross-cultural Translations
The PSS has been translated and cross-culturally adapted
into Brazilian Portuguese,78 Greek,221 and Chinese,48 with
psychometric evidence to support their use. The MDC for
the Greek PSS was 1.87 points.221 The MDC for the Chinese
PSS was 6.34 points.48
Pain VAS and EPQ
I The 10-cm VAS has been evaluated for reliability,
validity, and responsiveness for ratings of “usual”
pain, “worst” pain, and pain during activity (VAS
for activity, also known as the EPQ).47,70 Chesworth et al47
evaluated the test-retest reliability of the VAS for worst pain
in 18 patients with PFP and found moderate reliability (r =
0.60). Crossley et al70 evaluated the test-retest reliability of
the VAS for worst pain and the VAS for usual pain in 17
patients with PFP and found moderate reliability for both
measures (ICC = 0.76 and 0.56, respectively). Crossley et
al70 also evaluated the test-retest reliability for VAS pain
during 6 aggravating activities (walking, running, squatting,
sitting, ascending stairs, and descending stairs), with the
combined score being referred to as the VAS for activity or
EPQ. The VAS for activity’s test-retest reliability was excel-
lent (ICC = 0.83).70 Concurrent validity, assessed with cor-
relation of change (Spearman rho), in each outcome
instrument with the GROC was –0.67 for the VAS for usual
pain, –0.68 for the VAS for worst pain, and –0.68 for the
VAS for activity. Responsiveness was defined as the per-
ceived rating of change. Each outcome measure’s median
change score could discriminate between those who im-
proved and those who were worse or stayed the same. The
treatment effect size was 0.95 for the VAS for usual pain,
1.09 for the VAS for worst pain, and 0.76 for the VAS for
activity. The MCID for each measure was 1.5 to 2 cm for the
VAS for usual pain, 2 cm for the VAS for worst pain, and 8
to 13 cm for the VAS for activity.
Numeric Pain-Rating Scale
I Piva et al231 assessed the responsiveness of the
11-point numeric pain-rating scale (NPRS), with 0
being “no pain” and 10 being the “worst imaginable
pain,” in 60 individuals with PFP before and after an inter-
vention program. The NPRS had a moderate standardized
effect size (0.74) and demonstrated excellent discrimination
between those whose scores worsened and those whose
scores did not (AUC = 0.84). The MCID for the NPRS was
–1.2 points for a decrease in pain score, according to the ROC
curve.
The FIQ and Modified FIQ
The FIQ is an 8-item questionnaire for knee function due to
a variety of knee disorders, including PFP. It is scored out of
16 points, with higher scores indicating less disability. The
modified FIQ is a 10-item questionnaire for knee pain and
function for a variety of knee disorders, including PFP. The
modified FIQ is scored out of 100 points, with higher scores
indicating greater disability and worse pain.
I The psychometric properties of the English version
of the FIQ have been examined in 2 level I stud-
ies.47,70 The test-retest reliability was fair in both
studies: Chesworth et al47 (r = 0.48) and Crossley et al70 (ICC
= 0.49). Concurrent validity was assessed in comparison with
the GROC, and the Spearman rho was 0.65.70 Responsiveness
was defined as the perceived rating of change. The FIQ me-
dian change score could discriminate between those who
improved and those who were worse or stayed the same.70
The treatment effect size was 0.49.70 The FIQ had an MCID
of 2 points or 13% of the total score.70
IV Selfe et al259,260 investigated the reliability and valid-
ity of the modified FIQ in 77 participants (66.2%
female). The modified FIQ is a 10-item question-
naire whose language was modified for a European popula-
tion and that includes additional questions modified from the
AKPS. Internal consistency, measured with Cronbach’s alpha,
was .83.260 Test-retest reliability was assessed by calculating
the mean of 2 modified FIQ scores and then subtracting each
individual score from the mean to determine the error for
each individual score. Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z sta-
tistic, the error scores were found to be normally distributed,
indicating acceptable test-retest reliability (1.24; P = .09).260
FIQ Cross-cultural Translations
The FIQ has been translated and cross-culturally adapted
into Brazilian Portuguese78 and Persian,208 with psychometric
evidence to support their use.
Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome Severity Scale
The Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome Severity Scale (PSS) is
a 10-item VAS questionnaire for knee pain severity during
various activities in persons with AKP, scored out of 100, with
higher scores indicating less disability.
I Laprade and Culham175 developed the PSS and
evaluated its validity and test-retest reliability in 29
military participants with PFP (7 females). Concur-
rent validity was assessed by comparison to the Western On-
tario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index
(WOMAC) and the Hughston Clinic subjective knee ques-
tionnaire, showing strong positive correlations with both
questionnaires (Spearman ρ = 0.72 and 0.83 for the WOMAC

Evidence Synthesis and Clinical Rationale
There are many PROMs for use with persons with PFP. Sev-
eral have been translated and cross-culturally adapted from
English to various languages and cultures. At this time, the
strongest evidence for validity, reliability, and responsive-
ness to change exists for the AKPS, KOOS-PF, and VAS for
activity (EPQ). The AKPS has several translated and cross-
culturally adapted versions, with varying levels of evidence
to support their validity, reliability, and responsiveness to
change. The VAS for worst pain and VAS for usual pain have
moderate reliability, concurrent validity, and responsiveness
to change. The NPRS has evidence for responsiveness to
change. Several additional PROMs have varying evidence
to support their use as measures of pain and function in
persons with PFP.
Recommendation
A Clinicians should use the AKPS, KOOS-PF, or VAS
for activity (EPQ) questionnaires to measure pain
and function in patients with PFP. In addition, cli-
nicians should use the VAS for worst pain, the VAS for usual
pain, or the NPRS to measure pain. Clinicians should use one
of the translations and cross-cultural adaptations with dem-
onstrated validity, reliability, and responsiveness to change
for patients in different countries and for those requiring
questionnaires in languages other than English.
ACTIVITY LIMITATIONS
Physical Performance Measures
I The most accurate diagnostic clinical test for PFP
is reproduction of pain with squatting.64,215 The
squatting maneuver is performed in a manner that
feels normal to the individual. The test has a high –LR of 0.10
to 0.20 (95% CI: 0.1, 0.4) (TABLE 2), indicating that the prob-
ability of PFP being present when there is a negative test is
moderately decreased.63,215,303
I Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were
calculated for pain with stair climbing and pain
with kneeling. These tests demonstrated moderate
to high sensitivity and –LR (TABLE 2), suggesting that the
probability of PFP is moderately decreased when there is a
negative test.63,65,205
I Collins et al61 conducted a retrospective review of 4
separate studies of persons with PFP, including 459
total participants, and found that 54.4% of persons
with PFP reported increased knee pain with prolonged sit-
ting. Pain with prolonged sitting was found to have low to
moderate diagnostic accuracy in an earlier systematic re-
view,64 which suggests that its presence may be a diagnostic
indicator for PFP (TABLE 2).
Patellofemoral Pain and Osteoarthritis Subscale of the KOOS
I Crossley et al73 developed and evaluated a new KOOS
subscale, the patellofemoral pain and osteoarthritis
subscale (KOOS-PF). The KOOS-PF is an 11-item
questionnaire for pain, stiffness, and quality of life in persons
with PFP and knee OA. It is scored out of 100 points, with
higher scores meaning less disability.73 In evaluating the mea-
surement properties of the KOOS-PF in 132 patients, the in-
ternal consistency was .86 (Cronbach’s alpha), the test-retest
reliability was 0.86 (ICC), and the SEM was 6.8. The structural
validity loaded mostly on 1 factor, “knee pain relating to activi-
ties that load the PF joint,” with an eigenvalue of 4.29. The
KOOS-PF demonstrated moderate to good construct validity
(convergent validity) with the AKPS (r = 0.74) and Medical
Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36)
physical component summary (r = 0.45). Construct validity
was also established by a hypothesized low correlation of the
KOOS-PF score with the SF-36 mental component summary
(r = 0.07) (divergent validity). The KOOS-PF demonstrated
good discriminant validity; those with higher levels of baseline
pain had lower baseline KOOS-PF scores, and vice versa. The
KOOS-PF change scores had fair responsiveness compared to
GROC scores (r = 0.52). The individual MDC of the KOOS-PF
was 16 points. The minimal important change was 14.2 points.
No floor or ceiling effects were reported.
The IKDC
The IKDC is a 10-item questionnaire for knee symptoms,
function, and sports participation, with a maximum score
of 100 points (least disability). The IKDC is designed for
persons with orthopaedic conditions of the knee, includ-
ing PFP.
IV Siqueira et al265 evaluated the IKDC in 31 patients
with PFP. Criterion validity of the IKDC was examined
through comparison of scores with the KOS-ADLS
using a Spearman correlation test. The IKDC was moderately
correlated with the KOS-ADLS (ρ= 0.46). Test-retest reliability
of the IKDC was excellent (Spearman ρ = 0.96).
Lysholm Scale
The Lysholm scale is an 8-item questionnaire for knee symp-
toms, signs, and disability scored out of 100 points (100 is the
least disability). It was originally designed for patients fol-
lowing knee ligament surgery but has been studied in other
populations, including patients with PFP.101 Psychometric
properties of the Lysholm scale are reported in the System-
atic Reviews section under Esculier et al.101
Lysholm Scale Cross-cultural Review
The Lysholm scale has been translated and cross-culturally
adapted into Turkish, with psychometric evidence to support
its use.46

ue.63,65,126,210,215 Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios are
available in TABLE 3.
Patellar Mobility Tests
II The patellar tilt test, a measure of lateral retinacu-
lar tightness, has low to moderate intratester (κ =
0.28-0.50) and intertester reliability (κ = 0.19-
0.71).300,301 Yet, Haim et al126 reported high specificity (0.92;
95% CI: 0.75, 0.98) and a moderate +LR of 5.4 for the patel-
lar tilt test, meaning that a positive finding would be useful
for ruling in a diagnosis of PFP.
II The vastus medialis coordination test was designed
to assess the mobility of the patella during an active
non–weight-bearing maneuver. Nijs et al210 report-
ed high specificity (0.93; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.99) and +LR (2.26;
95% CI: 1.9, 2.9) for this test (TABLE 3).
III There is a paucity of reliability and validity data for
a number of tests to assess passive accessory motion
of the patella relative to the femur (passive gliding
patella, lateral pull test, patellar inferior pole test), with the
reported data indicating poor to fair reliability (κ = 0.31-
0.59).126,275,300 These patellar mobility tests demonstrate low
diagnostic accuracy for PFP (TABLE 3).
Foot Position Tests
II The navicular drop test is used to assess the amount
of subtalar pronation.263 Interrater and intrarater
reliability (ICC = 0.87-0.93 and ICC = 0.78-0.81,
respectively) for the navicular drop test in patients with PFP
is good to excellent (TABLE 3).16,230
II Selfe et al261 used the FPI to identify patients with
pronated feet. The FPI is a 6-item scale that assesses
foot position based on talar head palpation, the cur-
vature above and below the lateral malleolus, rearfoot inver-
sion/eversion, and forefoot abduction/adduction. Patients with
higher scores have more pronated feet.248,249,261 The reliability
and validity of this measure are fair to good (ICCs from 0.52
to 0.93) (TABLE 3).16,66,249
III Midfoot width measured in a non–weight-bear-
ing and a weight-bearing position has been used
to measure foot mobility. Like the FPI, the mid-
foot width measurement has excellent reliability and valid-
ity (ICC = 0.97-0.99).192 The MDC95 is 0.14 cm for the
midfoot difference in weight bearing and 0.31 cm for the
midfoot difference in non–weight bearing.192 Mills et al196
reported that individuals with PFP who had a 1.1-cm or
greater difference on the test had significantly greater im-
provements in pain with the use of foot orthoses compared
to controls.
I The eccentric step-down test demonstrates
moderate specificity (0.82; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.93)
and +LR (2.3; 95% CI: 1.9, 2.9), suggesting that
the probability of PFP being present when there is a posi-
tive test is moderately increased (TABLE 2).215 Reproduc-
tion of AKP during the test is considered a positive test
result.210
II Another test to assess movement quality is the
FPPA during the SLS. The FPPA, a measure of
knee valgus, is calculated by drawing a line on a
photo from the anterior superior iliac spine to the midpoint
of the tibiofemoral joint, and another line from the mid-
point of the tibiofemoral joint to the midpoint of the ankle
mortise, and measuring the resulting angle.308 The FPPA
has acceptable between-day reliability for healthy men (ICC
= 0.88; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.93) and women (ICC = 0.72; 95%
CI: 0.56, 0.82) as a test for increased knee valgus during the
SLS (TABLE 2).201
II Harris-Hayes et al131 performed a cross-sectional
study of 30 athletes to determine the reliability of
video assessments of lower extremity movement pat-
terns (FPPA) and the construct validity of the measurement.
Observers classified lower extremity movement patterns as
dynamic valgus (greater than 10° in the positive direction),
dynamic varus (greater than 10° in the negative direction), or
no change (less than 10° in either direction). They reported
kappa values ranging from 0.80 to 0.90 for intratester reli-
ability and 0.75 to 0.90 for intertester reliability.
III Piva et al230 developed an assessment of the quality
of movement during a lateral step-down test to as-
sess lower extremity biomechanics during a dynam-
ic task in individuals with PFP. Intertester reliability varies
from 0.67 to 0.81 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.94),81,230,242 with 80% rater
agreement (TABLE 2).230
Recommendation
B Clinicians should administer appropriate clinical or
field tests that reproduce pain and assess lower-
limb movement coordination, such as squatting,
step-downs, and the SLS. These tests can assess a patient’s
baseline status relative to pain, function, and disability; glob-
al knee function; and changes in the patient’s status through-
out the course of treatment.
PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENT MEASURES
Patellar Provocation Tests
III Patellar pain provocation tests (compression test,
Waldron test phases 1 and 2, patellar grind test, and
Clarke’s sign) have shown low diagnostic val-

Recommendation
C When evaluating a patient with PFP over an epi-
sode of care, clinicians may assess body structure
and function, including measures of patellar provo-
cation, patellar mobility, foot position, hip and thigh muscle
strength, and muscle length.
BEST-PRACTICE POINT
Essential Data Elements
Clinicians should document the following measures, at least
at baseline and discharge or at 1 other follow-up point, for
all patients with PFP to support standardization for quality
improvement in clinical care and research.
Diagnosis of PFP
• Retropatellar or peripatellar pain
• Reproduction of retropatellar or peripatellar pain with squat-
ting, stair climbing or descent, prolonged sitting, or other
functional activities loading the PFJ in a flexed-knee position
• Exclusion of all other possible sources of AKP
• Patellofemoral pain cluster of findings
Classification of PFP
• Overuse/overload without other impairment
- Eccentric step-down test
• PFP with muscle performance deficits
- HipSIT
- Thigh strength testing
• PFP with movement coordination deficits
- Dynamic valgus on lateral step-down test
- Frontal plane valgus
• PFP with mobility impairments
- Hypermobility
• Foot mobility testing
- Midfoot width in non–weight bearing and weight bearing
- FPI
- Hypomobility
• Lateral patellar retinaculum (patellar tilt test)
• Muscle length testing
- Hamstrings
- Gastrocnemius
- Soleus
- Quadriceps
- Iliotibial band
• Hip internal and external rotation ROM testing
Activity Limitations—Physical Performance Measures
• Pain with squatting
Activity Limitations—Patient-Reported Measures
• AKPS or KOOS-PF for function
• VAS for usual pain and VAS for worst pain or NPRS
Muscle Strength Tests
III The Hip Stability Isometric Test (HipSIT) is de-
signed to measure the strength of the entire pos-
terolateral hip musculature.4 The HipSIT has
demonstrated moderate to good concurrent validity com-
pared to individual posterolateral hip muscles (r = 0.51-0.65),
with excellent intratester and intertester reliability (ICC =
0.98-0.99). The MDC95 has been established for healthy con-
trols (0.036 kg of force/kg of body mass) and those with PFP
(0.034 kg of force/kg of body mass) (TABLE 3).4
IV Quadriceps strength testing with a mechanical dy-
nanometer using a maximum voluntary isometric
contraction is highly reliable (ICC = 0.97-0.98)
(TABLE 3).50
A challenge is to measure hip and thigh strength to identify
weakness. To date, isometric muscle testing with a handheld
dynamometer has been the most widely used assessment
tool.286 Proper testing methods are key to reliable and ac-
curate measurement (TABLE 3).2,30,165
Muscle Length Tests
I Limited data exist regarding hip flexor length and
hip internal and external rotation ROM. Hamstra-
Wright et al130 theorized that limited hip external
rotation could contribute to increased femoral internal rota-
tion during weight-bearing activities and increased lateral
PFJ loading.
III Piva et al230 established interrater reliability for
tests commonly used to assess flexibility in patients
with PFP. Hamstring, quadriceps, gastrocnemius,
and iliotibial band length tests had poor to excellent reliabil-
ity, with ICCs ranging from 0.29 to 0.97 (TABLE 3).16,230 Piva et
al230 also performed a multivariate stepwise discriminant
analysis to determine which measures were best for distin-
guishing between individuals with and without PFP. Of the
flexibility measures, only the gastrocnemius and soleus
lengths were identified. Weight-bearing ankle dorsiflexion
ROM was the only factor associated with an increased FPPA
during the SLS,242 suggesting that gastrocnemius length may
impact movement during the SLS.
PFP Cluster of Findings
III A cluster of findings using a combination of history
elements and common physical examination tests
can be used to identify whether or not knee com-
plaints are likely due to PFP.81 Décary et al81 proposed 2 clus-
ters based on age, pain location, and clinical examination to
help in the diagnosis of PFP. These clusters had a +LR of 8.70
(95% CI: 5.20, 14.58). Similarly, 3 clusters were identified to
exclude PFP (–LR = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.27) (TABLE 4).

aThe individual performs a squatting maneuver that feels normal to him or her.
bThe individual climbs stairs in a manner that feels normal to him or her.
cThe individual kneels in a manner that feels normal to him or her.
dThe individual stands with the foot of the leg to be tested near the edge of a 20-cm-high step, with hands on hips and the contralateral leg over the floor and
the knee in extension. She or he bends the knee of the leg on the step, lowering the contralateral leg until the foot lightly touches the floor, and then straightens
the tested knee and returns to the start position. This motion is repeated 5 times. The examiner stands in front of the individual to observe the quality of move-
ment. Each repetition is scored using the following point system: (a) 1 point for an arm strategy to maintain balance, (b) 1 point for trunk lean to either side,
(c) 1 point for pelvic elevation and/or rotation to one side, (d) 1 point if the tibial tuberosity moves medial to the second toe or 2 points if the tibial tuberosity
moves past the medial longitudinal arch of the foot, and (e) 1 point if the affected limb wavers from side to side. Total quality-of-movement scores are inter-
preted as follows: 0 to 1, good; 2 to 3, moderate; and 4 or greater, poor.
eA measure of knee valgus formed by a line drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine to the midpoint of the tibiofemoral joint, and another line drawn from
the midpoint of the tibiofemoral joint to the midpoint of the ankle mortise.

aThe individual is supine, with knees extended. The therapist attempts to tilt the lateral aspect of the patella beyond the horizontal position, using the thumbs
on the lateral patellar border and the index fingers on the medial patellar border. The test is performed by moving the patella out of the trochlear groove later-
ally so that the anterior patella faces slightly medial.
bThe individual is supine, with knees extended. The therapist compresses the inferior pole of the patella while flexing the knee.
cThe individual is in a supine position, and the therapist pushes the patella directly into the femoral trochlea.
dThe individual is in a supine position, and the therapist pushes the patella against the femur with one hand while passively flexing the knee with the opposite hand.
eThe individual is in a standing position, and the therapist gently pushes the patella against the femur with one hand while the patient slowly performs a full squat.
fThe individual is supine, with the knee in slight flexion (not full extension, as this is reported to possibly cause pinching of the suprapatellar pouch). The clini-
cian glides the patella inferiorly and the individual contracts the quadriceps muscles.
gThe individual is supine, with knees extended. The therapist glides the patella superiorly/inferiorly and medially/laterally.
hThe individual is in a supine position, with the therapist stabilizing the test extremity in a neutral position, with the knee at 0° to 15° of flexion. The indi-
vidual performs an isometric quadriceps muscle contraction while the therapist observes the movement of the patella, with and without slight pressure to the
superior aspect of the patella.
iThe individual is supine, with knees extended. The therapist applies posteriorly directed pressure to the superior patella to tilt the patella anteriorly at its
inferior pole.
jThe individual is supine, with knee extended. The therapist places a fist under the knee of interest and the individual then slowly extends the knee to full end-
range extension.
kThe individual stands in a relaxed-stance position on both legs and is instructed to stand still, with arms by the side and looking straight ahead. The assessor
needs to be able to move around the individual during the assessment and to have uninterrupted access to the posterior aspect of the leg and foot. If an observa-
tion cannot be made (eg, because of soft tissue swelling), indicate on the data sheet that the item was not scored. A 5-point Likert-type scale, where lower scores
represent a more supinated foot position and higher scores represent a more pronated position, is used.
lThe individual stands in a relaxed-stance position on both legs. A caliper is used to measure the width of the midfoot at the point of 50% of the total foot length.
Following weight-bearing measurements, the individual is seated on the end of a table so that both lower legs hang in a perpendicular position to the floor, with
the feet non–weight bearing and the ankles slightly plantar flexed. In this position, the non–weight-bearing measurements of midfoot width are recorded.
mThe individual is in weight bearing and the subtalar joint is positioned in a neutral position, based on the clinician’s palpation. The distance from the floor to
the navicular tubercle is then measured. The patient then relaxes from this position (ie, relaxed calcaneal stance) and the measure is repeated. The difference in
distance from the navicular tubercle to the floor in both positions represents the amount of navicular drop.
nThe individual is sidelying, with both legs positioned at 45° of hip flexion and 90° of knee flexion, with the limb to be tested superior to the opposite limb. The
individual is instructed to lift the knee of the superior leg while keeping the heels in contact, so that the hip is in 20° of hip abduction. The dynamometer is
laterally positioned 5 cm above the lateral tibiofemoral joint line. To ensure that the individual is exerting a maximal effort, he or she is familiarized with the
procedure and receives verbal encouragement from the tester.
oThe individual is seated, with hips and knees in 90° of flexion. The distal tibia is secured to the dynamometer force arm just proximal to the lateral malleolus,
and rigid straps are used to stabilize the thigh and pelvis. The axis of rotation is adjusted to align with the lateral epicondyle of the femur. To ensure that the
individual is exerting a maximal effort, he or she is familiarized with the procedure and receives verbal encouragement from the tester and visual feedback from
the dynamometer’s real-time force display. The individual performs 3 practice trials, and testing is initiated after 5 minutes of rest. For the test, the individual
is instructed to maximally contract his or her quadriceps for 5 seconds. To avoid the influence of fatigue, the individual is given 2 to 3 minutes of rest between
trials. A quadriceps index is calculated as a strength test score after testing is completed: (involved-side maximum force/uninvolved-side maximum force) × 100.
pThe individual assumes a supine position on a mat table, with the hip of the tested leg flexed to 90° and the contralateral limb flush on the mat table. The knee
of the tested leg is flexed to 90°. The clinician then extends the knee to the maximum position, per the patient’s tolerance. The stationary arm of the goniom-
eter is aligned with the greater trochanter. The axis of the goniometer is aligned with the lateral epicondyle of the knee. The movable arm of the goniometer is
aligned with the lateral malleolus of the ankle. An additional measurement method is to use an inclinometer, which is zeroed on a horizontal surface prior to
the measurement.
qThe individual assumes a prone position. The ipsilateral knee is passively flexed to the maximum position, per the patient’s tolerance, and anterior tilt of the
pelvis and/or extension of the lumbar spine is avoided. The stationary arm of the goniometer is aligned with the greater trochanter. The axis of the goniometer
is aligned with the lateral epicondyle of the knee. The movable arm of the goniometer is aligned with the lateral malleolus of the ankle. An additional measure-
ment method is to use an inclinometer, which is zeroed on a horizontal surface prior to the measurement.
rThe individual assumes a supine position on a mat table, with the ankle and foot suspended over the edge of the table and the ankle dorsiflexed in a subtalar
joint neutral position. The stationary arm of the goniometer is aligned with the fibular head. The axis of the goniometer is placed just distal to the lateral mal-
leolus. The movable arm of the goniometer is aligned parallel with the plantar aspect of the calcaneus and fifth metatarsal. To measure gastrocnemius length,
the knee is extended to 0° and a measurement of ankle dorsiflexion is recorded. To measure soleus length, the knee is flexed to 45° and a measurement of ankle
dorsiflexion is recorded.
sThe individual assumes a sidelying position on a mat table, with the pelvis, trunk, and shoulders aligned in the vertical plane. The tested leg is positioned
superiorly and the ipsilateral knee flexed to 90°. The clinician stabilizes the pelvis with the proximal hand while the inferior hand grasps just inferior to the
knee. The clinician moves the individual’s ipsilateral hip first in flexion, then through abduction and extension, until the hip is positioned in midrange abduc-
tion and neutral flexion and extension. The clinician then lowers the thigh into adduction (toward the table) until the thigh stops moving. A positive test is
indicated when the thigh remains in an abducted position (above the horizontal) when the hip abductor muscles are not contracting. An additional measure-
ment method is to use an inclinometer, which is zeroed on a horizontal surface prior to the measurement.

INTRODUCTION
The literature on nonsurgical interventions for individu-
als with PFP includes individual and combined interven-
tions. The goal of trunk, hip, thigh, and lower extremity
strengthening and stretching exercises is to address muscle
performance deficits, movement coordination deficits, and
mobility impairments. Exercise therapies consist of knee-
and/or hip-targeted exercises performed in weight-bearing
or non–weight-bearing positions, or both. Due to the het-
erogeneous nature and combination of multiple interven-
tions for the treatment of individuals with PFP, results are
often provided based on combined interventions. Combined
interventions consist of 3 or more adjunctive interventions,
such as foot orthoses, manual therapy, or patellar taping,
with exercise therapy. Finally, adjunctive interventions such
as biophysical agents, gait retraining, and dry needling were
reviewed in isolation from exercise therapies when possible.
Each body of evidence was synthesized separately and then
overall to support the overarching recommendation for each
intervention. To maintain consistency with the most recent
international expert consensus meeting on the treatment of
PFP published in 2016,75 systematic reviews and RCTs were
assigned levels of evidence. These levels of evidence corre-
sponded with the respective AMSTAR and Physiotherapy
Evidence Database (PEDro) scores: high quality (7/10 or
greater), moderate quality (4-6/10), and low quality (3/10
or less). Studies were assessed for outcomes in the short
term (less than 3 months), medium term (3-12 months),
and long term (greater than 12 months), as described by
Lack et al.168
SPECIFIC MODES OF EXERCISE THERAPY
COMPARED WITH CONTROL
I A high-quality systematic review identified 38 level
I and level II studies supporting combined inter-
ventions of exercise therapy, consisting of knee-
targeted exercise therapy or knee- and hip-targeted exercise
therapy, combined with foot orthoses, patellar taping, patel-
lar mobilization, and/or vasti biofeedback for the treatment
of PFP compared with no care or with placebo.143 Four ad-
ditional systematic reviews also support the use of combined
interventions for the treatment of PFP.54,164,168,289 Further, a
2016 Cochrane review concluded that exercise therapy re-
duces pain (SMD, –1.46; 95% CI: –2.39, –0.54) and improves
function (SMD, 1.62; 95% CI: 0.31, 2.94) with moderate to
large effect sizes, when compared with control or sham thera-
pies, in the short term.290 In the medium to long term, exer-
cise therapy results in large reductions in usual pain (SMD,
4.32; 95% CI: 0.89, 7.75) and large improvements in function
(SMD, 1.1; 95% CI: 0.58, 1.63) in individuals with PFP, when
compared with control or sham therapies.290
Gaps in Knowledge
Although exercise therapy is recommended for PFP to reduce
pain in the short, medium, and long term, and to improve
function in the medium and long term, optimal dosage is
currently unclear, in part due to inadequate exercise report-
ing in the literature.143 Further research is needed to under-
stand which dosage parameters (eg, session duration and
frequency, exercise intensity, etc) are associated with better
pain, function, and quality-of-life outcomes.
Knee-Targeted Exercise Therapy
Non–Weight Bearing (Open Chain) Versus Weight Bearing
(Closed Chain)
Evidence suggests that weight-bearing and non–weight-bear-
ing quadriceps-strengthening exercises result in differential
patterns of PFJ loading.98,239 Therefore, non–weight-bearing
and weight-bearing exercises each have theoretical advantag-
es and disadvantages that may influence a patient’s response.
Short-term Outcomes
II Two moderate-quality RCTs have compared short-
term outcomes in individuals with PFP who com-
pleted programs of either non–weight-bearing or
weight-bearing knee-targeted exercises. In a moderate-qual-
ity RCT, Herrington and Al-Sherhi135 reported equivalent
reductions in pain and improvement in function at 6 weeks
in individuals who completed weight-bearing versus non–
weight-bearing knee-targeted exercises. Most importantly,
both weight-bearing and non–weight-bearing knee-targeted
exercises were superior to control (wait and see).135
Similarly, a moderate-quality RCT by Bakhtiary and Fatemi14
reported large pain reductions in individuals with PFP who
completed a 6-week program of either non–weight-bearing
or weight-bearing knee-targeted (quadriceps-strengthening)
exercises, with no differences between the 2 exercise modes.
Bakhtiary and Fatemi14 did not include a no-intervention
control group, and therefore it is unclear whether findings of
pain reductions in either exercise group would exceed “wait
and see.”

Medium-term Outcomes
II In the medium term, a moderate-quality RCT by
Witvrouw et al314 reported that 5 months of weight-
bearing knee-targeted exercise resulted in only
slightly greater reductions in pain, rated on a VAS, in individu-
als with PFP compared with those treated with non–weight-
bearing knee-targeted exercise. They reported no differences
in functional outcomes between the 2 groups in the medium
term.314 However, it should be noted that there was no control
group. Therefore, it is unclear whether medium-term out-
comes for either weight-bearing or non–weight-bearing knee-
targeted exercises are greater than “wait and see.”
Long-term Outcomes
I Five-year outcomes from a high-quality RCT312 re-
ported that while both non–weight-bearing and
weight-bearing exercises reduced PFP, neither was
superior. At the 5-year follow-up, slightly higher functional
scores on the AKPS were reported in those treated with non–
weight-bearing exercises.
Gaps in Knowledge
While neither weight-bearing nor non–weight-bearing
knee-targeted exercise therapy demonstrated superiority
compared to one another in the short, medium, and long
term,132,164,250,289 it is not yet known whether either is superior
to control in the medium and long term.
High Versus Low Volume of Knee-Targeted
Exercise Therapy While Avoiding Pain
II A single moderate-quality RCT reported greater
short- and medium-to-long-term reductions in pain
and improvements in function with the step-down
test using a high-volume (3 sets of 30 or more repetitions, 3
times per week for 12 weeks), knee-targeted exercise therapy
program (deloaded, unweighted) that avoided any pain exacer-
bation; it was coupled with 30 minutes of aerobic cycling and
compared with a low-volume exercise program (3 sets of 10 rep-
etitions, 3 times per week for 12 weeks) that also avoided pain
exacerbation and included 10 minutes of aerobic cycling.217,218,289
Gaps in Knowledge
The cited evidence to support high-volume exercise is from
a single cohort and lacked a control group of wait and see.
Thus, additional research is needed to make a definitive
recommendation regarding high- versus low-volume knee-
targeted exercise therapy.
Hip-Targeted Exercise Therapy Compared With Control
Short-term Outcomes
II A single moderate-quality RCT compared a group
that received 8 weeks of non–weight-bearing, hip-
targeted exercise therapy utilizing elastic bands to
a group that received a control therapy of nutritional supple-
mentation for the treatment of PFP.159 In the short term, large
reductions in pain (SMD, 2.80; 95% CI: 1.71, 3.88) and im-
provements in function on the WOMAC (SMD, 2.88; 95%
CI: 1.78, 3.98) were reported for the hip-targeted exercise
therapy group when compared with the control.
Gaps in Knowledge
Due to the moderate quality of evidence supporting hip-tar-
geted exercise therapy compared with control, further high-
quality RCTs evaluating the efficacy of hip-targeted exercise
therapy in the medium and long term, along with consider-
ation of optimal dosage parameters, may allow a more defini-
tive recommendation.
Hip-Targeted Exercise Therapy Compared
With Knee-Targeted Exercise Therapy
Short-term Outcomes
I A high-quality RCT assessed an 8-week interven-
tion of hip-targeted exercises compared with knee-
targeted exercises and reported superior outcomes
for pain and function in the group that completed the hip-
targeted exercises.84 It should be noted that weight-bearing
exercises, including leg presses, step-downs/step-ups, and
squats, were considered, in addition to resisted non–weight-
bearing knee extension exercises, to be knee-targeted exer-
cises. Indeed, these weight-bearing exercises result in high
levels of gluteal activity.251 The hip-targeted exercise group
completed exercises that included non–weight-bearing hip-
strengthening exercises but also several weight-bearing exer-
cises, such as the SLS and lunges, that have previously been
reported to result in high levels of quadriceps muscle activity
(greater than 50% to 60% maximal voluntary isometric
contraction).26,104
I In a high-quality RCT,3 individuals with PFP ran-
domized to 4 weeks of isolated hip-targeted exer-
cise therapy prior to 4 weeks of isolated
knee-targeted exercise therapy experienced greater improve-
ments in hopping performance and functional scores (via the
Kujala questionnaire) compared with individuals who re-
ceived 4 weeks of knee-targeted exercise therapy prior to 4
weeks of hip-targeted exercise therapy. Regardless of group
assignment, all exercises were performed for 3 sets of 10 rep-
etitions at 60% of 10-repetition maximum.
I Two high-quality meta-analyses found small short-
term effects favoring hip-targeted exercises over
knee-targeted exercises for improving pain (SMD,
0.36; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.59) and function (SMD, 0.18; 95% CI:
0.05, 0.42) in individuals with PFP.168,289 Caution is urged, as
these meta-analyses included the studies by Ferber et al105
and de Marche Baldon et al84 as hip-targeted exercises versus
cpg36 | september 2019 | volume 49 | number 9 | journal of orthopaedic & sports physical therapyPatellofemoral Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesPatellofemoral Pain: Clinical Practice Guidelines
ulations, in particular high-demand athletes and adolescents,
as nothing is known about the effectiveness of hip-targeted
versus knee-targeted exercise therapy for PFP treatment
in these population subsets. Finally, greater consistency in
the delineation of hip-targeted exercise therapy and knee-
targeted exercise therapy will assist with interpretation and
implementation of results from future clinical trials.
Combined Hip- and Knee-Targeted Exercise Therapy
Compared With Knee-Targeted Exercise Therapy Alone
Short-term Outcomes
I Compared with knee-targeted exercise therapy, 3
high-quality meta-analyses agree that the combina-
tion of hip- and knee-targeted exercise therapy re-
sulted in better outcomes in the short term.168,204,289
Specifically, 1 meta-analysis found small effects favoring com-
bined hip- and knee-targeted exercises compared with knee-
targeted exercises with respect to usual pain (SMD, 0.55;
95% CI: 0.22, 0.59) and patient-reported function (SMD,
0.42; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.81).168 However, it is noteworthy that
the majority of the RCTs included in the meta-analyses did
not control for exercise volume in the respective knee-target-
ed and combined hip- and knee-targeted exercise protocols.
Therefore, the differences in patient outcomes may be due to
greater exercise volume in the combined hip- and knee-tar-
geted exercise protocols.
Medium-term Outcomes
I Based on 2 high-quality RCTs,90,107 2 high-quality
meta-analyses reported large effects for pain reduc-
tion in the medium term in favor of combined hip-
and knee-targeted exercise therapy over knee-targeted
exercise therapy.168,289 Similarly, these meta-analyses168,289
reported large effects in favor of combined hip- and knee-
targeted exercise therapy for improvements in patient-re-
ported function, based on 2 high-quality RCTs.90,107 A
high-quality RCT reported a large effect in favor of combined
hip- and knee-targeted exercise therapy over knee-only exer-
cise therapy on single-leg hop scores in the medium term
(SMD, 1.54; 95% CI: 0.89, 2.18).107
Long-term Outcomes
I To date, only 1 high-quality RCT compared long-
term outcomes for pain, patient-reported function,
and functional performance between patients who
received either combined hip- and knee-targeted exercise
therapy or knee-only targeted exercise therapy. Fukuda et
al107 reported a large effect in favor of combined hip- and
knee-targeted exercise therapy over knee-targeted exercise
alone on pain reduction (SMD, 2.99; 95% CI: 2.16, 3.83),
patient-reported function on the LEFS (SMD, 2.65; 95% CI:
1.86, 3.43) and AKPS (SMD, 1.78; 95% CI: 1.12, 2.45), and on
the single-leg hop test (SMD, 2.1; 95% CI: 1.40, 2.79).
knee-targeted exercises, despite the confounding nature of
their respective exercise programs.
II In a moderate-quality trial, Ferber et al105 reported
that 6 weeks of hip-targeted exercises or knee-tar-
geted exercises both reduced pain and improved
function via AKPS scores in individuals with PFP, but there
were no differences between the groups. The hip-targeted ex-
ercise group performed standing exercises that used a cable
column to provide external resistance to the hip abductors and
hip internal and external rotator musculature. The knee-tar-
geted exercise group performed non–weight-bearing and
weight-bearing exercises. Non–weight-bearing exercises in-
cluded isometric quadriceps exercises and knee extension ex-
ercises, whereas weight-bearing exercises included step-downs,
the SLS and double-leg squats, and forward lunges. Care
should be taken when interpreting the findings,105 as high lev-
els of hip muscle activity (greater than 60% maximal voluntary
isometric contraction) were previously reported in the weight-
bearing knee exercises used in this study.99,251 No wait-and-see
control group was included in this study.105
II Two moderate- and 1 high-quality RCTs compared
hip exercises that targeted the posterolateral hip
musculature (eg, sidelying hip abduction) to knee-
targeted exercises that targeted the quadriceps musculature
(eg, non–weight-bearing knee extension).90,105,158 All 3 studies
reported that hip-targeted exercise therapy resulted in supe-
rior outcomes relating to pain reduction and improved func-
tion compared with knee-targeted exercise therapy.
In contrast, a moderate-quality RCT31 found improvements
in pain and function, assessed via a VAS and the AKPS, in
individuals who received 6 weeks of either knee-targeted
exercise therapy or hip- and core-targeted exercise therapy.
However, there were no between-group differences. Because
a control group was not included, it is unknown whether im-
provements with either exercise protocol were greater than
“wait and see.”
Medium-term Outcomes
I Based on 2 high-quality RCTs,83,158 a 2015 high-
quality systematic review concluded that hip-tar-
geted exercise resulted in medium effects of greater
pain reduction (SMD, 1.07; 95% CI: 0.55, 1.59) and PROMs
(SMD, 0.87; 95% CI: 0.36, 1.37) compared with knee-target-
ed exercise in the medium term.167
Gaps in Knowledge
While short- and medium-term outcomes favor hip-target-
ed exercise therapy over knee-targeted therapy, long-term
outcomes are currently unknown. Further research should
include evaluation of long-term outcomes across diverse pop-

term.15,42,60,274 Specifically, systematic reviews have reported
no benefit, conflicting evidence, and large positive benefits
of patellar taping for pain.15,42 The inconsistencies relate to
different meta-analysis processes and definitions of time
points, types of taping (tailored and untailored), and subse-
quent pooling. For example, Callaghan and Selfe’s42 Co-
chrane review reported no benefit from taping, but defined
“short term” as 3 months or less and pooled findings of vari-
ous taping techniques and time points from 1 week to 3
months. Collins et al60 and Barton et al15 considered taping
techniques and time points separately. Both reviews report-
ed limited evidence from 1 high-quality study305 indicating
that tailored patellar taping combined with exercise pro-
duces large reductions in pain (effect size unable to be esti-
mated, as the taping group was pain free) in the short term
(4 weeks). Additionally, these reviews reported limited evi-
dence from 1 high-quality study53 that combining medially
directed, untailored taping does not provide any additional
benefit to exercise and education, or education alone. Tap-
ing applied with the aim of enhancing muscle function does
not provide any benefits in relation to pain and function
when combined with exercise therapy.15
II A 2018 moderate-quality RCT reported no added
improvements in pain or function when patellar
taping was combined with intensive physical ther-
apy (12 sessions over 4 weeks), including knee-targeted exer-
cise and manual therapy.114 However, interpretation of how
to apply these findings is challenging because taping methods
were poorly described in this study.
II A 2017 moderate-quality RCT reported equivalent
outcomes for pain or function after comparing su-
pervised exercise therapy targeting the hip and
knee (12 sessions over 6 weeks), when combined with taping
to facilitate medial quadriceps activity, to sham taping and
no taping.123
Gaps in Knowledge
Although tailored patellar taping in conjunction with exer-
cise therapy appears to improve outcomes in the short term
for individuals with PFP, long-term evaluation of taping ap-
proaches for PFP is needed.
Recommendation
B Clinicians may use tailored patellar taping in com-
bination with exercise therapy to assist in immedi-
ate pain reduction, and to enhance outcomes of
exercise therapy in the short term (4 weeks). Importantly,
taping techniques may not be beneficial in the longer term or
when added to more intensive physical therapy. Taping ap-
plied with the aim of enhancing muscle function is not
recommended.
Gaps in Knowledge
More high-quality RCTs are needed in specialized popula-
tions, such as high-demand athletes or adolescents, and to
determine optimal dosage parameters for combined hip- and
knee-targeted exercise. Future RCTs should also match exer-
cise volume between knee-targeted and combined hip- and
knee-targeted exercise programs.
Recommendation
A Clinicians should include exercise therapy with
combined hip- and knee-targeted exercises in the
treatment of individuals with PFP to reduce pain
and improve patient-reported outcomes and functional per-
formance in the short, medium, and long term. Hip-target-
ed exercise therapy should target the posterolateral hip
musculature. Knee-targeted exercise therapy includes ei-
ther weight-bearing (resisted squats) or non–weight-bear-
ing (resisted knee extension) exercise, as both exercise
techniques target the knee musculature. Preference to hip-
targeted exercise over knee-targeted exercise may be given
in the early stages of treatment of PFP. Overall, the combi-
nation of hip- and knee-targeted exercises is preferred over
solely knee-targeted exercises to optimize outcomes in pa-
tients with PFP.
Patellar Taping
Many taping protocols for individuals with PFP have been
proposed and evaluated in the literature, with each aimed
at altering PFJ kinematics to reduce PFJ stress.67 Common
methods include the tailored McConnell taping technique,
where rigid taping is applied with the aim of reducing any
combination of lateral patellar glide, tilt, and rotation,67
to reduce pain during a functional task (eg, step-down)
during the clinical consultation. Other common methods
include untailored medial patellar glide–only taping156 and
taping aimed at enhancing vastii muscle activation and
synergy.176
I Pooled data from 6 high-quality studies indicate
that tailored patellar taping provides large reduc-
tions in pain (SMD, 2.43; 95% CI: 1.98, 2.89) dur-
ing a range of functional tasks in the immediate term.15
Specifically, tailored patellar taping involves a combination
of techniques to support patellar tilt, glide, and rotation, tai-
lored to optimize pain outcomes during a functional task (eg,
step-down). Pooled data from 3 high-quality studies indicate
that untailored medially directed taping (ie, 1 strip of tape)
produces immediate, small pain reductions (SMD, 0.50; 95%
CI: 0.22, 0.79) during functional tasks.
I There are conflicting findings from 4 high-quality
systematic reviews regarding the potential value
of patellar taping beyond the immediate
cpg38 | september 2019 | volume 49 | number 9 | journal of orthopaedic & sports physical therapyPatellofemoral Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesPatellofemoral Pain: Clinical Practice Guidelines
CI: 2.7, 46.9). Vicenzino et al296 reported that the presence of
any 3 of the following 4 predictors (age greater than 25 years,
midfoot-width difference greater than 10.96 mm, height less
than 165 cm, and worst pain on a VAS less than 53.25/100
mm) increased the likelihood of success for foot orthoses for
PFP by 8.8 times (95% CI: 1.2, 66.9).
I In 2 high-quality RCTs, prefabricated foot orthoses
modified to optimize comfort were reported to pro-
vide greater global improvement in patients with
PFP when compared to flat inserts at 6 weeks.56,196 However,
one of these high-quality studies indicated that there was no
clear benefit of adding prefabricated foot orthoses to a com-
bined physical therapy program over a combined physical
therapy program alone in the short (6 weeks), medium (12
weeks), or long (52 weeks) term.56
I A 2018 high-quality RCT indicated that in a sub-
group of people with PFP and excessive static rear-
foot eversion (greater than 6°), supervised
foot-targeted exercises (12 sessions over 3 months) and cus-
tomized foot orthoses, combined with 3 sessions of physical
therapy (education, manual therapy, and knee-targeted exer-
cises), produced superior pain and function outcomes at 4
months compared with 3 sessions of physical therapy alone.197
No between-group differences were found at 12 months. Due
to the study design, it is unclear whether superior outcomes
were the result of the additional foot-targeted exercise, foot
orthoses, or additional extensive physical therapy contact.
II A moderate-quality systematic review of 7 studies
involving 700 participants (76.8% female) reported
that, despite limited evidence, prefabricated foot
orthoses, as compared with flat inserts, provided greater
short-term (6 weeks) improvements in function as measured
by self-reported outcomes and global improvement scores.23
The addition of physical therapy interventions to the foot or-
thosis intervention demonstrated significantly greater im-
provements in the FIQ in the short term and in the AKPS in
the intermediate term.
Gaps in Knowledge
Due to the study design and findings of Mølgaard et al,197
future research should aim to determine whether custom-
ized foot orthoses, coupled with supervised foot-targeted
exercises, are superior to education, manual therapy, and
knee-targeted exercise therapy in the short and medium
term, provided that the dosage of physical therapy is matched
between interventions. None of the clinical prediction studies
have been validated with appropriate follow-up methodology,
indicating that further work is necessary before guidance on
who is most likely to benefit from foot orthoses can be pro-
vided to help guide clinical practice.
Patellofemoral Knee Orthoses (Bracing)
I Comparing patellofemoral knee orthoses (knee
brace, sleeve, or a patellar strap) plus exercise ther-
apy versus exercise therapy alone, a high-quality
2015 Cochrane review267 concluded that patellofemoral knee
orthoses did not have a meaningful effect on pain in the short
term (mean difference, –0.46; 95% CI: –1.16, 0.24). The Co-
chrane review noted the very low quality of evidence and
heterogeneity of the types of braces (knee brace, sleeve, and
strap) across the various studies.267
Gaps in Knowledge
Considering the low quality of research on patellofemoral
knee orthoses, further high-quality clinical trials are needed
to compare the impact of different types of braces on pain
and functional outcomes when combined with exercise.
Recommendation
B Clinicians should not use patellofemoral knee or-
thoses, including braces, sleeves, or straps, for the
treatment of individuals with PFP.
Foot Orthoses
The presence of excessive static or dynamic foot pronation has
traditionally been the rationale for prescribing foot orthoses
for individuals with PFP122; however, the results are inconsis-
tent. Some studies indicate a likelihood of success with signs
of greater dynamic pronation22 or foot mobility,21,196,273,296 some
report success with signs of less foot mobility,21,196,273,296 and
others report success unrelated to foot posture and mobil-
ity.21,196,273,296 Based on moderate- and high-quality systematic
reviews and panel voting, the 2016 international expert con-
sensus meeting75 concluded that prescribing prefabricated foot
orthoses may be useful for short-term pain reduction.
I A high-quality Cochrane review of 2 studies involv-
ing 210 participants reported that foot orthoses
resulted in better improvements in knee pain (risk
ratio = 1.48; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.99) compared with flat orthoses
at the 6-week time point, but not at 1-year follow-up.145 The
combination of physical therapy and foot orthosis interven-
tion demonstrated no significantly greater improvements in
PROMs than physical therapy alone at any time point.
I A high-quality systematic review by Matthews et
al189 reported 14 factors associated with a successful
outcome after foot orthosis treatment across 6
studies. Barton et al21 reported that the presence of any 3 of
4 predictors (footwear motion-control properties greater
than 5.0, usual pain on a VAS less than 22.0/100 mm, weight-
bearing ankle dorsiflexion ROM less than 41.3° with the knee
flexed, and reduced pain during the SLS) increased the likeli-
hood of success for foot orthoses for PFP by 11.1 times (95%

focused on load management (avoid running hills
and reduce run-session volume while increasing
session frequency) combined with five 10-minute sessions of
instruction on running modification. The running modifica-
tion education consisted of instruction to increase running
cadence, reduce audible sound of foot strike, and/or alter foot
strike from rearfoot to forefoot. However, combining patient
education on load management with running modification
was no more effective in the medium term than patient edu-
cation on load management alone for runners with PFP, and
was no more effective than hip- and knee-targeted exercise
therapy plus patient education.100 There was no control group
included in this study. Therefore, it is unknown whether the
improvements noted with the 3 interventions exceeded “wait
and see.”
II In a moderate-quality RCT, 8 sessions of gait re-
training over 2 weeks in rearfoot-strike runners,
consisting of cuing to alter foot strike from rearfoot
to forefoot using a faded-feedback design, were more effec-
tive at reducing pain immediately following the conclusion of
the retraining period and at short-term follow-up (4 weeks)
compared with a control group that received a graded in-
crease in running volume matching the gait retraining
group.252
II A moderate-quality RCT reported that runners
treated with 10 sessions of gait retraining to in-
crease running cadence by 10%, combined with the
use of minimalist, barefoot-mimicking footwear for 20% of
running volume, had greater pain reductions compared with
runners treated with foot orthoses prescribed to optimize
comfort.35
III A 2016 systematic review based on 2 moderate-
quality case series212,309 concluded that 8 sessions of
gait retraining using visual feedback and a faded-
feedback design on what were deemed to be excessive proxi-
mal running mechanics (ie, peak hip adduction) during
running resulted in large reductions in pain as assessed with
a VAS (SMD, 3.84; 95% CI: 2.70, 4.98), with concurrent
large increases in function as measured by the LEFS (SMD,
2.16; 95% CI: 1.29, 3.03).206
Gaps in Knowledge
Further research should include comparisons of running gait
retraining, patient education, and hip- and knee-targeted ex-
ercise therapy, with an adequate length of interventions and
long-term follow-up. It should be determined whether gait
retraining needs to be targeted to a specific running mecha-
nism thought to contribute to the etiology of PFP, or whether
Recommendation
A Clinicians should prescribe prefabricated foot or-
thoses for those with greater than normal prona-
tion to reduce pain in individuals with PFP, but
only in the short term (up to 6 weeks). If prescribed, foot
orthoses should be combined with an exercise therapy pro-
gram. There is insufficient evidence to recommend custom
foot orthoses over prefabricated foot orthoses.
Biofeedback
EMG-Based Biofeedback-Assisted Knee Exercise Therapy
II Electromyography-based biofeedback has been pro-
posed to encourage preferential recruitment of the
medial vastii musculature to reduce lateral patello-
femoral tracking in individuals with PFP.180 Two moderate-
quality RCTs have examined whether EMG-based biofeedback
can improve therapeutic outcomes in individuals with PFP;
both reported no added benefit over knee-targeted (quadri-
ceps) exercise alone.94,321 Subsequent low- and high-quality
meta-analyses concluded that biofeedback-assisted quadriceps
exercise therapy had no added benefit over knee-targeted
(quadriceps) exercise therapy alone for the treatment of PFP.
Because there was no control group in these studies, it is not
possible to determine whether the knee-targeted exercise pro-
grams used in these studies were superior to wait and see.60,169,299
Recommendation
B Clinicians should not use EMG-based biofeed-
back on medial vastii activity to augment knee-
targeted (quadriceps) exercise therapy for the
treatment of PFP.
Hip- and Knee-Targeted Exercise Therapy Completed With
Visual Biofeedback Compared With Hip- and Knee-Targeted
Exercise Therapy in the Absence of Visual Biofeedback
Short-term and Medium-term Outcomes
I A single high-quality RCT found that improvements
in reported pain and function (assessed via the AKPS)
were noted after 4 weeks of rehabilitation and at 3
and 6 months post rehabilitation in individuals with PFP, re-
gardless of whether visual biofeedback on lower extremity
alignment was provided during combined hip and knee exer-
cises, such as the SLS.90 Furthermore, there were no differences
in trunk and lower extremity mechanics between the 2 treat-
ment groups during a single-leg step-down task after rehabilita-
tion was completed. Last, while both groups exhibited increased
posterolateral hip and quadriceps isometric strength after the
intervention, there were no differences between groups.
Recommendation
B Clinicians should not use visual biofeedback on lower
extremity alignment during hip- and knee-targeted
exercises for the treatment of individuals with PFP.

dividuals, less active individuals may be at greater risk for
adverse events, such as rhabdomyolysis.147
Recommendation
F Clinicians may use blood flow restriction plus high-
repetition knee exercise therapy, while monitoring
for adverse events, for those with limiting painful
resisted knee extension.
Needling Therapies
Two common forms of needling used in practice have been
evaluated in the literature. These include acupuncture (East-
ern medicine) and dry needling (Western medicine). While
acupuncture is not practiced by physical therapists in the
United States, it is practiced by physical therapists in other
countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia.
I A single high-quality RCT reported no added im-
provements in patient pain or function after 3 ses-
sions of trigger point dry needling of the vastii
musculature when combined with knee exercise therapy and
manual therapy targeting the PFJ.102
I A single high-quality RCT comparing trigger point
dry needling (6 sites in the quadriceps) to sham
(same 6 sites using a sharp object with a plastic
guide tube, but not puncturing the skin) reported no benefit
of dry needling on pain or disability in individuals with PFP
immediately or 72 hours following treatment.273
II A single moderate-quality RCT, synthesized in a
high-quality systematic review, indicates that acu-
puncture produces a moderate positive effect on
pain reduction compared to no treatment in the medium
term (5 months) (SMD, 0.65; 95% CI: 0.13, 1.16).60
Evidence Synthesis and Gaps in Knowledge
Although 1 study points to the effectiveness of acupunc-
ture, this was in comparison to no treatment, highlighting
the need for a placebo/sham-controlled trial. Additionally,
acupuncture has not been evaluated in comparison to, or in
combination with, exercise therapy. Therefore, it is unclear
whether similar findings to those identified with dry needling
may occur (ie, no added value to exercise therapy). No stud-
ies have compared acupuncture to dry needling approaches
in individuals with PFP. These gaps in research should be
addressed to allow clearer recommendations in relation to
acupuncture.
Recommendations
A Clinicians should not use dry needling for the treat-
ment of individuals with PFP.
gait retraining can be applied evenly across runners regard-
less of running mechanics. It is currently unknown which cri-
teria identify patients with PFP who would benefit the most
from the addition of gait retraining to their rehabilitation
programs. Because the retraining interventions that resulted
in a reduction in pain were associated with more intensive re-
training (ie, more retraining sessions), future research should
also assess optimal dosage of retraining sessions. With the
majority of this research involving small RCTs (10 per group)
or case series, it is unclear which gait retraining intervention
is most effective, and whether it is superior to patient educa-
tion on load management.
Recommendation
C Clinicians may use gait retraining consisting of
multiple sessions of cuing to adopt a forefoot-strike
pattern (for rearfoot-strike runners), cuing to in-
crease running cadence, or cuing to reduce peak hip adduc-
tion while running for runners with PFP.
Blood Flow Restriction Training Plus High-
Repetition Knee-Targeted Exercise Therapy
I A single level I high-quality RCT reported no dif-
ference in Kujala score or worst pain between
healthy adults with PFP who received 8 weeks of
standard knee exercise therapy (3 sets of 7 to 10 repetitions
at approximately 70% of 1-repetition maximum) and those
who received 8 weeks of blood flow restriction training plus
high-repetition knee exercise therapy (1 set of 30 repetitions
or volitional failure, followed by 3 sets of 15 repetitions, all at
30% of 1-repetition maximum).115 While a significantly great-
er reduction in pain VAS score during ADLs was observed in
the blood flow restriction group compared with standard
knee-targeted exercise therapy, between-group differences on
the VAS did not exceed the MCID (20 mm).58 A subgroup
analysis revealed that those with painful resisted knee exten-
sion experienced greater increases in quadriceps strength
with blood flow restriction therapy plus knee exercise therapy
than did those who received only standard knee exercise
therapy.
Evidence Synthesis and Gaps in Knowledge
Additional studies are required to make a definitive recom-
mendation regarding the use of blood flow restriction train-
ing in conjunction with high-repetition knee exercise therapy
for the treatment of individuals with PFP. Future high-quali-
ty RCTs should utilize appropriately powered sample sizes to
more clearly identify subgroups of people, such as individu-
als with painful resisted knee extension, who may experience
greater improvements with blood flow restriction training
and across various demographics. While blood flow restric-
tion therapy appears to be safe and to present no greater risk
than standard strengthening programs in healthy, active in-

Gaps in Knowledge
Low-quality systematic reviews on manual therapy have
frequently included studies in which the effects of manual
therapy could not be differentiated from exercise therapy,
indicating a need for greater stringency with inclusion cri-
teria and methodological design. With most of the current
evidence relating to single moderate-quality RCTs, further
high-quality RCTs evaluating the efficacy of combining man-
ual therapy with exercise therapy are needed to allow more
definitive recommendations.
Evidence Synthesis and Clinical Rationale
Based on evidence from high-quality systematic reviews and
panel voting, the most recent international expert consensus
meeting75 concluded that manual therapy, including lumbar,
knee, or patellofemoral manipulation/mobilization, may
not improve outcomes, particularly when used in isolation.
Although manual therapy has been used in evidence-based
combined interventions, its use may not improve outcomes,
particularly when used in isolation, and thus is not recom-
mended. Because exercise therapy is the consistent com-
ponent in combined intervention studies, manual therapy
should not reduce the time available to provide appropriate
exercise therapy in patients with PFP.
Recommendation
A Clinicians should not use manual therapy, includ-
ing lumbar, knee, or patellofemoral manipulation/
mobilization, in isolation for patients with PFP.
Biophysical Agents
Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation–Assisted Quadriceps Exer-
cise Therapy Compared With Quadriceps Exercise Therapy Alone
II A single moderate-quality RCT reported no added
benefit of neuromuscular electrical stimulation tar-
geting the vastus medialis musculature plus knee-
targeted (quadriceps) exercise therapy when compared to
exercise therapy alone.27
II A low-quality systematic review subsequently con-
cluded that neuromuscular electrical stimulation
does not have any added benefit when combined
with quadriceps exercise therapy for the treatment of PFP.169
Ultrasound and Other Electrophysical Agents
Based on evidence from low- and moderate-quality system-
atic reviews and panel voting, the 2016 international expert
consensus meeting75 concluded that ultrasound and other
electrophysical agents may not improve outcomes.
II A low-quality systematic review of 12 studies evalu-
ated the use of several different electrophysical
agents for PFP treatment.169 One low-quality study
C Clinicians may use acupuncture to reduce pain in
individuals with PFP. However, caution should be
exercised with this recommendation, as the superi-
ority of acupuncture over placebo or sham treatments is un-
known. This recommendation should only be incorporated
in settings where acupuncture is within the scope of practice
of physical therapy.
Manual Therapy as a Stand-Alone Treatment
A 2018 low-quality systematic review concluded that there
is no benefit from manual therapy (patellar or lumbar) in
isolation.150
Patellar mobilization has been combined with other physical
therapy interventions with reported effectiveness. There is a
high degree of variance in the practice of manual therapy in
clinical practice and when evaluated in research, with each
having different rationales for its use, including improved lo-
cal and remote joint mobility and reduced muscle and fascial
tension.
I A high-quality RCT reported greater reduction in
pain following retropatellar and peripatellar isch-
emic pressure (15 sessions) compared to hip mus-
culature ischemic pressure (15 sessions), but no control group
was included.127
II A low-quality RCT226 synthesized in 2 systematic
reviews (1 of high quality and the other of low qual-
ity)60,150 concluded that 2 weeks of treatment with
medial glides, tilt mobilizations, and local lateral retinacular
massages did not result in reduced levels of pain when com-
pared with a no-intervention control.
II A moderate-quality RCT269 synthesized in a high-
quality systematic review60 yielded no benefit by
adding spinal manipulation to patellar mobiliza-
tion over 4 weeks.
II A moderate-quality RCT reported greater reduction
in resting pain when exercise was combined with
knee mobilization with movement (tibiofemoral)
compared to exercise combined with an elastic taping
method.85
II A moderate-quality RCT reported that the addition
of 12 patellar taping applications may be more ben-
eficial for reducing pain than 12 sessions of patellar
mobilization, when combined with an exercise program of
stretching and combined knee- and hip-targeted exercise.160
The time frame for delivery of these sessions could not be
determined.

Recommendation
F Clinicians may include specific patient education
on load management, body-weight management
when appropriate, the importance of adherence to
active treatments like exercise therapy, biomechanics that are
thought to contribute to relative overload of the PFJ, the evi-
dence for various treatment options, and kinesiophobia. Pa-
tient education may improve compliance and adherence to
active management and self-management strategies and is
unlikely to have adverse effects.
Combined Interventions
Combined interventions consist of combining 3 or more of
the following interventions: foot orthoses, EMG biofeedback
for vastii retraining, patellar mobilizations, patellar taping,
and exercise therapy.
Short-term Outcomes
I Based on 2 high-quality RCTs,57,68 a high-quality
meta-analysis concluded that 6 weeks of combined
interventions (knee- and hip-targeted exercise
therapy combined with directional patellar taping, patellar
mobilizations, and EMG biofeedback) is superior to placebo
(sham shoe inserts or sham physical therapy), with moderate
effects (SMD, 1.08; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.43).60 Exercise therapy
combined with foot orthoses resulted in significant moderate
effects for pain reduction compared with foot orthoses
alone.23,57
Medium-term Outcomes
I Combined interventions, consisting of patellar tap-
ing, EMG biofeedback for the quadriceps muscula-
ture, knee-targeted exercise therapy, patellar
mobilizations, and lower-limb stretching plus foot orthoses,
resulted in significant moderate effects for pain reduction
compared with foot orthoses alone.23,56 In the medium to long
term, combined interventions that included exercise therapy
resulted in large reductions in usual pain (SMD, 4.32; 95%
CI: 0.89, 7.75) and large improvements in function (SMD,
1.1; 95% CI: 0.58, 1.63) in individuals with PFP compared
with control or sham therapies.290
Long-term Outcomes
I Six weeks of combined interventions, consisting of
patellar taping, patellar mobilizations, EMG bio-
feedback for the quadriceps musculature, knee-
targeted exercise therapy, and lower-limb stretching,
resulted in a moderate treatment effect (SMD, 0.44; 95%
CI: 0.01, 0.88) with respect to pain compared with placebo
shoe inserts or foot orthoses at 1-year follow-up.60 Adding
foot orthoses to the same 6-week combined intervention
also resulted in a moderate effect (SMD, 0.77; 95% CI: 0.33,
1.21) compared with placebo at 1-year follow-up. However,
evaluated the effects of multimodal interventions (ultrasound
and ice massage, ice bags, phonophoresis, and iontophoresis)
on symptoms and thigh muscle strength, functional mea-
sures, and thigh muscle activation; 3 studies evaluated the
effects of electrical stimulation on pain; and 1 study reported
on the effects of laser therapy. This review reported no ad-
ditional benefits from these electrophysical agents for the
management of PFP.
Recommendation
B Clinicians should not use biophysical agents, in-
cluding ultrasound, cryotherapy, phonophoresis,
iontophoresis, electrical stimulation, and therapeu-
tic laser, for the treatment of patients with PFP.
Patient Education
Currently, there is no evidence from RCTs to support the
benefits of education compared to control, wait and see,
or in addition to interventions such as exercise therapy
when treating PFP. Previous investigations evaluating pa-
tient education have used it as a comparison intervention
or in addition to other interventions like exercise therapy.
The majority of this research generally indicates that com-
bining exercise therapy with education produces superior
outcomes to education alone.53,198,247,268,292 However, the
specifics of education provided in these studies are not
clear, and, as such, value and quality are unable to be de-
termined. In a recent moderate-quality RCT by Esculier et
al100 in runners with PFP, education related to load man-
agement alone produced similar outcomes for running-
related pain when compared with education combined
with 8 weeks of exercise therapy, and education combined
with running retraining primarily focused on increasing
cadence. This highlights the potential value of education,
but more research is needed in this area. Regardless of the
limited evidence base to support patient education in the
management of PFP, international experts suggest that it
may be the key to successful management.18
Gaps in Knowledge
Due to the limited and low quality of evidence available,
further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of
patient education for individuals with PFP. It is presently
unknown whether tailored patient education is superior to
universal patient education. Recently, it was determined that
tailored online education delivered every other week was
more effective than a single session of general education on
injury prevention strategies for runners136; however, the ef-
fects on risk of PFP were not studied. Thus, the most effective
frequency and mode of delivery of patient education are also
in need of further study.

the key signs and symptoms associated with serious patho-
logical knee conditions, continually screen for the presence
of these conditions throughout treatment, and immediately
initiate referral to the appropriate medical practitioner when
a potentially serious medical condition is suspected (Guide
to Physical Therapist Practice 3.0; http://guidetoptpractice.
apta.org/). Medical conditions for which physical therapy is
not indicated must be considered as possible etiologies of a
patient’s symptoms.
Component 2
Differential evaluation of musculoskeletal clinical findings
determines the most relevant physical impairments associat-
ed with the patient’s reported activity limitations and medical
diagnosis.157 Clusters of these clinical findings are described
as impairment patterns in the physical therapy literature,
and are labeled according to the key impairment(s) of body
function associated with that cluster. The authors propose a
classification system for PFP, with subcategories named ac-
cording to the primary impairments. These impairment-pat-
tern subcategories for PFP are described in the Diagnosis and
Classification sections of this CPG. The ICD-10 and primary
and secondary ICF codes associated with PFP are provided
in the Methods section of this CPG. These impairment pat-
terns impact the selection of interventions, which focus on
normalizing the key impairments of body function, which in
turn should improve the movement and function of the pa-
tient and lessen or alleviate the activity limitations commonly
reported by the patients who meet the diagnostic criteria of
that specific pattern. The FIGURE lists the key clinical findings
used to rule in or rule out the common impairment patterns
and their associated medical conditions. Impairment-based
classification is critical for matching the intervention strat-
egy that is most likely to provide the optimal outcome for
a patient’s clinical findings.157 However, it is important for
clinicians to understand that the impairment pattern, the
most relevant impairments of body function, and the associ-
ated intervention strategies often change during the patient’s
episode of care. Thus, continual re-evaluation of the patient’s
response to treatment and the patient’s emerging clinical
findings is important for providing optimal interventions
throughout the patient’s episode of care.28
Component 3
Irritability is a term used by rehabilitation practitioners to
reflect the tissue’s ability to handle physical stress,190,200 and is
presumably related to physical status and the extent of injury
and inflammatory activity that is present. McClure and Mi-
chener190 proposed operational definitions for tissue irritabil-
ity for persons with shoulder pain that could be used to guide
intensity and selection of interventions. These include high,
moderate, and low irritability levels, which are characterized
by pain intensity and disability level, as well as provocation of
there were no differences in 1-year outcomes between the
combined intervention and the combined intervention plus
foot orthoses.60
Evidence Synthesis
While combined interventions were different across studies,
exercise therapy was present in all successful combined in-
tervention programs.
Gaps in Knowledge
While investigations demonstrate that combining interven-
tions for the treatment of individuals with PFP is beneficial,
the best combination of exercise therapy and adjunctive
treatments is still unclear. It is likely that tailoring various
components of combined interventions may result in the
best patient outcomes. As of this guideline, it is yet unknown
which criteria are most helpful in prescribing an interven-
tion with the fewest components that yields the best patient
outcomes.
Recommendation
A Clinicians should combine physical therapy inter-
ventions for the treatment of individuals with PFP,
which results in superior outcomes compared with
no treatment, flat shoe inserts, or foot orthoses alone in the
short and medium term. Exercise therapy is the critical com-
ponent and should be the focus in any combined intervention
approach. Interventions to consider combining with exercise
therapy include foot orthoses, patellar taping, patellar mobi-
lizations, and lower-limb stretching.
DECISION TREE MODEL
A pathoanatomical/medical diagnosis of PFP can provide
valuable information in describing tissue pathology and may
assist in nonoperative planning and prognosis. The proposed
model for examination, diagnosis, and treatment planning
for patients with PFP uses the following components: (1)
medical screening, (2) classification of the condition through
evaluation of clinical findings suggestive of musculoskeletal
impairments of body functioning (ICF) and associated tis-
sue pathology/disease (ICD), (3) determination of irritability
stage and psychosocial factors that may impact treatment, (4)
evaluative outcome measures, and (5) nonoperative interven-
tion strategies. This model is depicted in the FIGURE.
Component 1
Medical screening incorporates the findings of the history
and physical examination to determine whether the patient’s
symptoms originate from a condition that requires referral
to another health care provider. Prior to diagnosing a person
with PFP, it is necessary to rule out all other possible medical
conditions that may cause AKP. Clinicians should recognize
cpg44 | september 2019 | volume 49 | number 9 | journal of orthopaedic & sports physical therapyPatellofemoral Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesPatellofemoral Pain: Clinical Practice Guidelines
signs and symptoms guide the clinician to classify the pa-
tient with one of the proposed impairment-based categories
of PFP. Interventions targeting the patient’s impairments are
listed in the FIGURE according to the PFP category. Because
irritability level often reflects the tissue’s ability to accept
physical stress, clinicians should match the most appropri-
ate intervention strategies to the irritability level of the pa-
tient’s condition.28,157 Additionally, clinicians should consider
influences from psychosocial factors9-11,186,187 in patients with
conditions in all stages of recovery.
LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
More research is needed to determine whether any long-term
differences in pain or PROMs occur in patients with PFP who
receive either hip- or knee-targeted exercise therapy. More
research is needed to gain greater understanding of outcome
differences between patients who receive a combination of
hip- and knee-targeted exercise therapy versus those who
receive knee-targeted exercise therapy alone. In addition, a
standardized approach is needed for future research when
delineating either knee- or hip-targeted exercise.
Despite compelling evidence for the use of exercise therapy in
the treatment of people with PFP, exercise programs reported
to be effective are unable to be replicated.143 Therefore, clini-
cians treating PFP are encouraged to use accepted exercise
prescription principles, as recommended by the American
College of Sports Medicine,7,322 to guide exercise prescrip-
tion targeting the hip and knee, based on individual deficits
identified in each patient. Specifically, the treating clinician
should assess, consider, and address appropriate neuromo-
tor control, along with muscular endurance, strength, and
power. Further guidance related to this is provided at https://
ipfrn.org/exercise-guide/.
There is a long-held belief among experts that tailoring and
targeting treatment to individual patients may improve the
effectiveness of physical therapy.18,80,310 However, to date,
there is little evidence for a validated approach to achieve
this. Nonetheless, the physical therapist is encouraged to use
clinical reasoning to target interventions toward individuals
when possible,18 and to use a shared decision-making process
during plan-of-care development.17
pain with ROM.190 Because irritability level and the duration
of symptoms do not always match, clinicians may be required
to make judgments when applying time-based research re-
sults to individual patients.28 Diagnosis of tissue irritability
is important for guiding clinical decisions regarding treat-
ment frequency, intensity, duration, and type, with the goal
of matching the optimal dosage of treatment to the status
of the tissue being treated.28,157 Using an approach similar to
that proposed by McClure and Michener,190 clinicians should
use tissue irritability as a factor to consider when determin-
ing intervention type and intensity. Patients with PFP with
high irritability (fairly constant pain greater than 5/10 that
fluctuates related to activity) may benefit from interventions
to reduce physical stress to the knee structures (eg, patel-
lar taping). Those patients with low irritability (intermit-
tent low-level pain less than 3/10 not easily aggravated) may
benefit from interventions that apply more physical stress to
the tissues of the knee, such as weight-bearing strengthen-
ing exercises, and thus provide appropriate stress to result in
adaptation of structures to increased load.200
Component 4
Outcome measures are standardized tools used for measur-
ing a specific domain, whether it is a body structure or func-
tion, activity limitation, or participation restriction, or for
determining a specific end point. They are important in di-
rect management of individual patient care, and they provide
the opportunity to collectively compare care and determine
effectiveness through the repeated application of a standard-
ized measurement. Outcomes in clinical practice provide the
mechanism by which the health care provider, the patient,
the public, and the payer are able to assess the end results
of care and its effect on the health of the patient and society.
Outcome measurements can identify baseline pain, function,
and disability, assess global knee function, determine readi-
ness to return to activities, and monitor changes in status
throughout treatment. Outcome measures can be classified
as PROMs, physical performance measures, and physical
impairment measures. Information for outcome measures is
detailed in this CPG’s Examination section.

Component 3: determination of irritability stage
Diagnosis of tissue irritability is important for guiding the clinical decisions regarding intervention frequency, intensity, duration, and
type, with the goal of matching the optimal dosage of intervention to the status of the tissue being treated. There are cases where
the alignment of irritability and duration of symptoms does not match, requiring clinicians to make judgments when applying
time-based research results on a patient-by-patient basis. Stage of irritability should classify the patient's condition as being
acute or nonacute, using the diagnostic indicators outlined in component 5.

CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION OF
STUDIES FOR REVIEW
Criteria for Considering Studies for Review
Inclusions: articles published in peer-reviewed journals that
include studies of the following types: systematic reviews, meta-
analyses, experimental and quasi-experimental, cohort, case
series, and cross-sectional studies.
Inclusion Criteria
Articles reporting on
• The functional anatomy of the patellofemoral joint
OR
• Tests and measures for diagnosis and/or differential diagnosis
of patellofemoral pain within the scope of physical therapist
practice, including but not limited to “specific tests and
measures”
OR
• Measurement properties of instruments and tests specific to
measuring patellofemoral pain, or patellofemoral pain–related
outcomes (including but not limited to symptoms, functions,
activity, and participation)
OR
• Measurement properties of instruments that are specific to
patellofemoral pain or lower extremity outcomes tested in pa-
tients with patellofemoral pain
OR
• Measurement properties of instruments using data from a
sample of patients with patellofemoral pain
OR
• Primarily adolescents (12 years of age or older) and adults with
patellofemoral pain
- Studies reporting on persons younger than 12 years of age
IF the proportion in the sample is small (less than 5%) OR
separate data are available for adults
AND
Patellofemoral pain, including the following topics:
• Risk of patellofemoral pain, including but not limited to range of
motion and body mass

not limited to pain location, duration, and quality and related
impairments and functional limitations
• Interventions within the scope of practice of physical thera-
pists, including but not limited to manual therapy, stretching
exercises, taping, orthotic devices, splints, neuromuscular re-
education, muscle strengthening, modalities, etc)
All outcomes were included.
Exclusion Criteria
Exclusions: meeting abstracts/conference proceedings, press
releases, theses, letters to the editor, authors’ responses, nonsys-
tematic review articles, case reports, and articles that cannot be

PROCEDURES FOR ASSIGNING LEVELS OF EVIDENCE
• Level of evidence is assigned based on the study design using
the Levels of Evidence table (APPENDIX F), assuming high quality
(eg, for intervention, randomized clinical trial starts at level I)
• Study quality is assessed using the critical appraisal tool, and
the study is assigned 1 of 4 overall quality ratings based on the
critical appraisal results
• Level of evidence assignment is adjusted based on the overall
quality rating:
- High quality (high confidence in the estimate/results): study
remains at assigned level of evidence (eg, if the randomized
clinical trial is rated high quality, its final assignment is level
I). High quality should include:
• Randomized clinical trial with greater than 80% follow-up,
blinding, and appropriate randomization procedures
• Cohort study includes greater than 80% follow-up
• Diagnostic study includes consistently applied reference
standard and blinding
• Prevalence study is a cross-sectional study that uses a
local and current random sample or censuses
- Acceptable quality (the study does not meet requirements
for high quality and weaknesses limit the confidence in the
accuracy of the estimate): downgrade 1 level
• Based on critical appraisal results
- Low quality: the study has significant limitations that sub-
stantially limit confidence in the estimate: downgrade 2
levels
• Based on critical appraisal results
- Unacceptable quality: serious limitations—exclude from
consideration in the guideline
• Based on critical appraisal results
