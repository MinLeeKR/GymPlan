Background: Although the United States is in the midst of a narcotic epidemic, risk factors for use and the
impact of perioperative narcotic use on total knee arthroplasty (TKA) outcomes is ill-defined.
Methods: A national database was queried for patients who underwent primary TKA from 2007 to 2015.
Patients taking narcotics in the preoperative, and for a prolonged period of time postoperatively, were
identified. The risk factors for prolonged narcotic use were analyzed with a regression analysis, in
addition to evaluating preoperative and prolonged postoperative use as independent risk factors for
short-term and long-term complications.
Results: In total, 113,337 patients met inclusion criteria, of which 31,733 patients were prescribed narcotics preoperatively and 35,770 patients were prescribed narcotics more than 3 months postoperatively.
There are several independent risk factors for prolonged narcotic use postoperatively, the most signifi-
cant being the number of narcotic prescriptions prescribed preoperatively. Preoperative narcotic use was
independently associated with an increased risk of emergency room visits, readmission, infection,
stiffness, and aseptic revision. Prolonged postoperative use was also associated with significantly
increased rates of infection, stiffness, and aseptic revision.
Conclusion: Preoperative and prolonged narcotic use following TKA was associated with an increased
risk of short-term and long-term complications following TKA. The liberal use of narcotics in the perioperative period should be considered a modifiable risk factor when considering elective TKA.

Nonsurgical knee osteoarthritis (OA) centers around weight
loss, physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications,
and corticosteroid injections [1]. Although these treatments can
provide symptomatic relief, as the severity of OA progresses, pain
management can become challenging for the treating physician.
Despite poor evidence supporting the use of opioids to treat
symptomatic knee OA, recent reports demonstrate a significant
number of patients presenting for total knee arthroplasty (TKA)
using narcotic medications for pain control [2e5]. Opioid use prior
to TKA can make optimal pain control in the postoperative period
challenging, and has also been shown to be associated with prolonged postoperative opioid use [6].
Despite increasing public health and media focus on the mortality associated with narcotic prescription use, there has been a
relative scarcity of literature describing the epidemiology of preoperative and prolonged postoperative narcotic use in patients
undergoing TKA and its impact on surgical outcomes [7e12]. A
recent study by Bedard et al [12] reported an increase in the
number of patients receiving opioid prescriptions within 3 months
prior to TKA from 2007 to 2014 in addition to several risk factors for
use after studying a large US insurance database. This study is in
agreement with similar studies detailing alarming trends of opioid
use prior to and following TKA, and other reports that patients who
use these medications obtain less pain relief from the operation
[13,14]. Although population-based studies have provided valuable
data on prescribing trends in the perioperative period, there is a
relative scarcity data describing the impact of opioid use on adverse
events following TKA. A recent study within the US Veterans Affairs
(VA) system was the first to demonstrate a significantly increased

The Journal of Arthroplasty 33 (2018) 113e118risk of knee revision during the first postoperative year in patients
with long-term opioid use prior to TKA [4]. Although this study
highlighted the substantive negative consequence of early TKA
failure in patients with long-term preoperative use, the study did
not investigate the impact or risk factors associated with prolonged
postoperative use on TKA outcomes. With an expected increase in
primary TKA of 673% by the year 2030, determining the impact of
opioid use for the management of perioperative pain for the patient
with symptomatic knee OA is of high clinical significance [15]. Thus,
the purpose of this study is to utilize a national insurance database
to characterize risk factors for prolonged narcotic use following
TKA and examine preoperative and prolonged postoperative
narcotic use as independent risk factors for complications following
TKA.
Materials and Methods
Database
The PearlDiver patient records database, an insurance-based
database of patient records (www.pearldiverinc.com, Fort Wayne,
IN), was utilized for this study. Data within this database are deidentified and anonymous and are thus exempt from Institutional
Review Board approval. This database contains data from several
different insurers, including both Medicare and Humana (private
insurer). Patients from this study were taken from the Humana and
Medicare datasets within the PearlDiver database. These datasets
were chosen for this study as they include prescription drug information and procedural laterality, both of which are necessary
data fields for the present investigation.
These datasets contain procedural volumes, basic patient demographics, laboratory data, and prescription drug information,
among numerous other data for patients with International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) diagnoses and procedures of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. This database
covers patients insured from 2007 to the first quarter of 2016, and
tracks patients across all inpatient and outpatient locations during
the time period studied. Overall, the database contains approximately 20 million patients with orthopedic diagnoses.
Study Cohorts
The database was first queried for patients who underwent
primary TKA using CPT 27447. Patients with subsequent contralateral TKA were included only once, for whichever procedure
occurred first. Any patients undergoing revision surgery of any sort
were excluded, including patients undergoing the second stage of a
staged revision for infection, using CPT coding. Only patients with a
minimum of 6-month postoperative database activity were
included to reduce the effect of transient patients who might have
changed health insurance during the study period. This query
resulted in 113,337 patients who underwent primary TKA for
further study.
Patients with prolonged postoperative narcotic use were then
identified within this cohort by querying prescription drug records
of the included patients. Only narcotic prescriptions filled by
patients generate a charge to the insurance company, thus all
prescriptions captured in the database were those filled by patients
and not just those prescribed by physicians. In accordance with
previously published orthopedic literature on narcotic use, prolonged postoperative narcotic use was defined as a patient filling a
prescription for a narcotic pain medicate between 3 and 6 months
postoperatively [16]. Six months was chosen as a cutoff to avoid
including patients who had subsequent surgeries or injuries that
narcotics prescriptions were filled for that were unrelated to the
TKA of interest. Relevant narcotic pain medications were determined through a systematic review of all patient records during
that time period and recording and using any narcotic pain medication filled by the patient population during the time period of
interest. The following narcotic prescriptions were included in the
analysis (both generic and brand name formulations): oxycodone
(with and without acetaminophen, controlled and extended
release, liquid and pill forms), hydrocodone (with acetaminophen,
with ibuprofen, normal and extra strength), hydromorphone,
oxycontin, oxymorphone (both normal and extended release),
morphine (including controlled and extended release), fentanyl,
and propoxyphene.
Patients with preoperative narcotic use were defined as those
filling at least one narcotic prescription between 4 months and 1
month prior to the date of TKA to reduce the risk of including
patients who filled postoperative prescriptions in the preoperative
period (as is done at our institution) and to avoid including patients
who filled pain medications in the remote preoperative time period
due to other surgeries or injuries. The number of filled narcotic
prescriptions in this time period was obtained, and then divided
into 1, 2, 3, or 4 preoperative filled prescriptions in the 3-month
preoperative time window. A breakdown of demographics and
relevant comorbidities for the overall study cohort, the preoperative narcotic use cohort, and the prolonged postoperative narcotic
use cohort is provided in Table 1.
Risk Factors for Prolonged Narcotic Use
Numerous risk factors and comorbidities for prolonged postoperative narcotic use were examined using a binomial logistic
regression analysis. Preoperative narcotic use was examined as a
risk factor, including filling any of the narcotics in the defined
preoperative window, in addition to the number of prescriptions
given during that period. The effect of other similar preoperative
prescriptions was also examined, including tramadol, anxiolytics
(alprazolam, diazepam, clonazepam, lorazepam, temazepam,
estazolam), muscle relaxants (cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine, baclofen), and methadone. The effect of preoperative substance use or
abuse was examined, including tobacco use, alcohol abuse, marijuana use or abuse, cocaine use or abuse, and amphetamine use or
abuse. Pertinent patient demographics and comorbidities were also
evaluated as risk factors, and included age, male sex, obesity,
morbid obesity, depression back pain and/or lumbago, migraine
headaches, and fibromyalgia. Finally, the following variables were
controlled for in the regression analysis but not specifically examined as risk factors: diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure, coronary
artery disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic lung disease, chronic
liver disease, inflammatory arthritis, current hemodialysis use, and
thyroid disease.
For each risk factor odds ratios (OR) were calculated from the
regression analysis, and a corresponding 95% confidence interval
and P values were also calculated. P < .05 was considered statistically significant.
Narcotics as a Risk Factor for Postoperative Complications
A binomial logistic regression analysis was also used to evaluate
any association between (1) preoperative narcotic use and (2)
prolonged postoperative narcotic use and specific early and late
complications following TKA. Preoperative narcotic use and the
number of preoperative narcotic prescriptions were evaluated as a
risk factor for the following complications: (1) an emergency room
visit within 30 days postoperatively, (2) readmission within 30 days
postoperatively, (3) infection within 1 year, including a diagnosis of
J.M. Cancienne et al. / The Journal of Arthroplasty 33 (2018) 113e118114infection (defined by ICD-9 coding) or a procedure for infection
(defined by CPT codes), (4) stiffness within 1 year postoperatively
(defined by a lysis of adhesions and/or manipulation under anesthesia using CPT coding), and finally (5) aseptic revision TKA at any
time point within the database. In order to increase the probability
that the above adverse events were in fact related to the surgery
performed and postoperative narcotic use and not an unrelated
event, a 30-day postoperative window was used.
In a similar manner, prolonged postoperative narcotic use was
evaluated as a risk factor for the following long-term complications
captured throughout the length of the database: (1) infection
including a diagnosis of infection (defined by ICD-9 coding) or a
procedure for infection (defined by CPT codes), (2) stiffness
(defined by a lysis of adhesions and/or manipulation under anesthesia using CPT coding), and (3) aseptic revision TKA.
Statistical Analysis
A binomial logistic regression analysis was used to assess the
independent effect of various risk factors for prolonged postoperative narcotic use, as well as for any association between
preoperative or prolonged postoperative narcotic use on complications following TKA. For all statistical calculations, P < .05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Risk Factors for Prolonged Use
Numerous significant risk factors for prolonged postoperative
narcotic use were identified (Table 2). The most significant risk
factor for prolonged postoperative use was filling a preoperative
narcotic prescription. Although filling a preoperative narcotic prescription (OR 5.47, P < .0001) was a significant risk factor, increasing
numbers of filled narcotic prescriptions resulted in substantially
higher odds of prolonged postoperative use, with ORs of 2.7-20.34.
Furthermore, the filling of other medications in the preoperative
period was also independent for prolonged postoperative use,
including anxiolytics (OR 1.52, P < .0001), muscle relaxants (OR
1.64, P < .0001), and methadone (OR 3.68, P < .0001). Preoperative

patients with chronic use to those without (Table 4).
Discussion
The opioid epidemic in the United States has become a public
health crisis, and opioid overdose has now surpassed motor vehicle
accidents as the leading cause of accidental death in this country
[17e21]. Although being greatly outnumbered by many other types
of providers, orthopedic surgeons prescribe more narcotics than
other surgical specialties and are the third most common prescription providers among all physicians [22,23]. Despite the current public health crisis, and the orthopedist’s indirect contribution
to the problem, few studies have described epidemiology of the
prescribing patterns and effects of opioids on common orthopedic
procedures, such as TKA [12,14]. Furthermore, the American
Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons evidence-based clinical practice
guidelines currently recommend neither for nor against the use of
opioid-containing medications for the treatment of knee OA,
making the perioperative pain management of these patients
challenging for both orthopedists and primary care specialists alike
[5]. This study identifies several independent risk factors for prolonged narcotic use postoperatively, the most significant being the
number of narcotic prescriptions filled preoperatively. Furthermore, preoperative narcotic use is independently associated with
an increased risk of several complications following TKA, including
emergency room visits, readmission, infection, stiffness, and
aseptic revision. Prolonged postoperative use was also associated
with significantly increased rates of infection, stiffness, and aseptic
revision.
Optimal pain control following TKA can be a challenging balance between effective pain control permitting mobilization and
physical therapy and the dangers of over sedation. An abundance
of recent literature has investigated the role of multimodal anesthesia for patients undergoing TKA in an attempt to decrease
postoperative narcotic use [24e26]. In order to implement these
strategies and prevent the long-term risks associated with prolonged postoperative narcotic use, independent patient-related
risk factors for prolonged use need to be identified. Utilizing the
same database, Bedard et al [12] studied 73,959 TKAs, 23,532 of
which used opioids prior to surgery, and identified several independent, patient-specific risk factors for increased use postoperatively. This study both corroborates and expands on the risk
factors identified in this study, and furthers an important clinical
analysis of risk factors for prolonged use postoperatively. For
instance, while patients aged <50 years at the time of TKA and
those with depression, back pain, tobacco use, and alcohol use
were also found to be independent risk factors for prolonged use
in this study, our analysis quantifies the impact of filling multiple
prescriptions, other preoperative prescriptions, substance abuse
patterns, and other demographics and comorbidities in order to
expand on the existing literature. Singh and Lewallen [27] utilized
the Mayo Total Joint Registry to analyze 7404 patients who
underwent primary TKA for risk factors associated with opioid use

J.M. Cancienne et al. / The Journal of Arthroplasty 33 (2018) 113e118116at 2 and 5 years after surgery. After examining gender, age, body
mass index, Deyo-Charlson index, depression, and anxiety with a
regression analysis, only anxiety was associated an increased risk
of opioid use at 2- and 5-year follow-up. Goesling et al [2]
furthered this research by studying 574 lower extremity arthroplasties and reported that patient’s symptoms of depression and
those taking opioids were significantly more likely to be on opioids 6 months after surgery. This study adds to other evidence
demonstrating that patients filling opioid prescriptions preoperatively are at significantly higher risk for prolonged use postoperatively [6]. In this study, we advance the current literature by
examining the degree of preoperative narcotic use, type of prescription, presence of substance abuse, and patient demographics
associated with poor pain control. As expected, patients who filled
more narcotic prescriptions, in addition to those filing certain nonnarcotic prescriptions, are at significantly increased risk for prolonged postoperative use. It is likely that patients filling multiple
narcotic prescriptions prior to surgery make opioid cessation
postoperatively challenging regardless of the procedure performed. These patients might be more prone to struggle with
opioid dependence or opioid-induced hyperalgesia, making it
challenging to discontinue such medications even after a clinical
improvement in joint pain. Furthermore, we found that tobacco
and alcohol abuse was also significantly associated with prolonged
postoperative narcotic use. Although it is beyond the scope of this
study to examine the complex psychosomatic mechanisms for
such a relationship, it is important to establish these patient
characteristics as risk factors for prolonged use. Finally, we were
able to identify several patient-specific demographics associated
with prolonged use that have yet to be discussed in the current
literature. These risk factors will further help to identify patients at
increased risk for prolonged postoperative narcotic use that can be
targeted for multimodal analgesia in the perioperative period to
help decrease their reliance on narcotics for pain relief postoperatively and avoid the associated complications.
Although it is important to provide epidemiological data and
identify risk factors for extended narcotic use following TKA, in the
era of bundled payments and outcome-based medicine it is
perhaps more important to assess what impact preoperative and
prolonged postoperative narcotic use has on surgical outcomes.
Ben-Ari et al [4] recently studied more than 30,000 primary TKAs
from the VA system and reported that long-term opioid use prior to
TKA was associated with a significantly higher risk of revision
within 1 year. This was the first study to demonstrate a statistically
higher revision risk in this subset of patients, and provides valuable
evidence to support limiting opioid use for the nonoperative
management of knee OA. Although this study provides novel data,
the male supermajority VA population and primary endpoint of
revision may limit its generalizability to a broader population.
Furthermore, the study was unable to link opioid use and cause for
revision. In this study, we also found that patients filling narcotics
prescriptions preoperatively had significantly higher rates of revision surgery, and furthered this analysis by demonstrating a statistically higher incidence of periprosthetic joint infection in these
patients as well. In addition, we examined early postoperative
metrics, and found that filling preoperative narcotic medications
was independently associated with emergency room visits and
readmission within 30 days. Finally, we found that filling preoperative narcotic prescriptions was associated with a higher risk of
stiffness requiring manipulation within 1 year of TKA. Although
increased emergency room visits and readmissions early in the
postoperative period in these patients might be expected, an
increased risk of infection and overall revision surgery is more
difficult to explain. It is unlikely that filling preoperative narcotic
prescriptions causes postoperative infection or loosening, and more
likely that narcotic use is a surrogate for patients with more complex socioeconomic situations and challenges that are unable to be
extracted from the database. Although further research is needed to
explain such mechanisms, this study provides novel evidence that
patients filling multiple narcotic prescriptions preoperatively
should be placed into a higher risk category of patients and a higher
likelihood for readmission, infection, and revision surgery. Thus, it
is important to utilize state wide prescription monitoring programs
to identify patients filling narcotic prescriptions in the preoperative
and postoperative periods.
Although there has been recent evidence linking preoperative
opioid and narcotic use with increased complications postoperatively, no studies to date have examined the impact of prolonged postoperative use as a risk factor for similar complications.
In this study, we are able to demonstrate significantly higher odds
of infection, stiffness requiring manipulation, and aseptic revision
TKA in patients who continue to fill narcotic prescriptions in the
prolonged postoperative period. Although we are unable to determine the reason these patients continue filling such prescriptions
postoperatively, the relationship between this and the complications exists, and patients continuing to use narcotics postoperatively should be counseled accordingly.
This study has several limitations, most all of which are
inherent to all studies utilizing administrative data [28,29]. First,
and most importantly, the results of this study are dependent on
the quality of data and the accuracy with which these procedures
and prescriptions are being coded, and miscoding and noncoding
by physicians and prescribers are potential sources of error. Second, the subjective nature of pain and its perception in the present
medical climate makes this area of research challenging to study.
As such, the prolonged use of narcotics following any surgery is
certainly influenced by several complex sociopsychological factors
including addictive behaviors, cultural norms, prescribing preferences, patient and surgeon expectations, and psychological wellbeing, none of which are able to be identified or quantified
within an administrative database such as PearlDiver. Third, due to
limitations of this database, we are unable to quantify the exact
dose of the narcotic filled or pill number, and therefore used
prescription as a unit of measurement. This limitation also precludes us from calculating a morphine-equivalence. Thus, there
may be patients prescribed with an overall small morphine
equivalent dose that are grouped into the preoperative or prolonged postoperative narcotic groups. Although this is a major
limitation to the study, and our results and conclusions must be
interpreted within this context, we believe that the national
perspective and exceedingly large cohort of patients examined in
this study provide a valuable addition to the literature. Furthermore, it encourages physicians and ancillary staff to look into
patient’s prescription filling history by using state wide prescription monitoring programs. Additionally, we cannot confirm or
deny that patients actually took the medicine as prescribed, only
that the prescription was given and filled by a pharmacy. Finally,
we were not able to determine the reason for narcotic prescription
either prior to or after surgery, or how many different prescribers
wrote narcotic prescriptions and what their specialty is. Patients
may have been using the narcotics prescribed for the acute postoperative period to help manage other chronic pre-existing conditions that were concurrently being treated. Although this would
have aided our analysis, the association remains valid regardless of
the reason for narcotic use. Despite the limitations of this study,
we believe that providing a national perspective on the prescription filling habits and clinical impact of narcotic use in the perioperative period is a valid and necessary use of a large,
administrative database. Short comings of institutional studies on
this topic are that they may not capture narcotics prescribed by
J.M. Cancienne et al. / The Journal of Arthroplasty 33 (2018) 113e118 117practitioners other than the treating surgeon, as a recent study
demonstrated that 77% of opioid prescriptions given to more than
350 total joint patients were written by a practitioner other than
the surgeon [3].
Conclusion
This study demonstrates a significantly higher rate of postoperative complications in patients who fill narcotic prescriptions
preoperatively and for a prolonged period of time postoperatively.
There are several independent, patient-specific risk factors for
prolonged postoperative narcotic use, the most significant of which
is preoperative use. Perioperative narcotic use should be considered among the modifiable risk factors and comorbidities when
deciding whether to perform TKA.
